Contracting officers and contract auditors have complementary roles
in the contracting process and are expected to collaborate to determine
fair and reasonable contract values, in accordance with <a class="xref file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/PGI_215.406-1.ditaxref:1;22:205" href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/pgi/memos/20091204%20Resolving%20Contract%20Audit%20Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">Director, Defense Procurement
and Acquisition Policy memorandum dated December 4, 2009, Subject:
Resolving Contract Audit Recommendations</a>. When a significant
disagreement arises on questioned costs, the contracting officer
and the auditor shall discuss the basis of the disagreement. The
contracting officer shall document that discussion and their disagreement
in a written communication to the auditor. The contracting officer
shall also document the disagreement in the prenegotiation objective
(or pre-business clearance). The contracting officer may then proceed with
negotiations when the prenegotiation objectives are approved.</p>

as the contracting officer planning to sustain less than 75-percent
of the total recommended questioned costs in a Defense Contract
Audit Agency (DCAA) audit report of a contractor proposal for an
initial contract or a contract modification with a value equal to
or greater than $10 million. It does not apply to costs that DCAA
has categorized as unsupported or unresolved in its audit report.</p>

has three days to elevate the issues within the contracting officer’s
activity after receipt of the contracting officers’ written communication
confirming the disagreement. Furthermore, DCAA may appeal the significant
issues up the chain of command as established in each Component’s
“Resolving Contract Audit Recommendations” policy. If issues remain,
the Director, DCAA may escalate from the Defense Component’s Head
of Contracting Activity or Senior Procurement Executive, to the
Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP). If
the DCAA Director believes that the Director, DPAP has not adequately
addressed the matter, the disagreement may finally be elevated to
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics,
and the Comptroller.</p>
