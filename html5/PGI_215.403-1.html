policy memorandum</a> . The intent is not to relieve entities that normally
perform Government contracts subject to TINA from an obligation to certify that
cost or pricing data are accurate, complete, and current. Instead, waivers must
be used judiciously, in situations where the Government could not otherwise
obtain a needed item without a waiver. A prime example would be when a
particular company offers an item that is essential to DoD’s mission but is not
available from other sources, and the company refuses to submit certified cost
or pricing data. In such cases, a waiver may be appropriate. However, the
procuring agency should, in conjunction with the waiver, develop a strategy for
procuring the item in the future that will not require such a waiver (e.g.,
develop a second source, develop an alternative product that satisfies the
department’s needs, or have DoD produce the item).</p>
