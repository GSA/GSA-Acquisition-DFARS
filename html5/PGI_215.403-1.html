            . The intent is not to relieve entities that
normally perform Government contracts subject to TINA from an obligation
to certify that cost or pricing data are accurate, complete, and
current. Instead, waivers must be used judiciously, in situations
where the Government could not otherwise obtain a needed item without
a waiver. A prime example would be when a particular company offers
an item that is essential to DoD’s mission but is not available
from other sources, and the company refuses to submit certified
cost or pricing data. In such cases, a waiver may be appropriate.
However, the procuring agency should, in conjunction with the waiver,
develop a strategy for procuring the item in the future that will
not require such a waiver (e.g., develop a second source, develop
an alternative product that satisfies the department’s needs, or
have DoD produce the item).</p>

The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data
may be waived for part of an offeror’s proposed price when it is
possible to clearly identify that part of the offeror’s cost proposal
to which the waiver applies as separate and distinct from the balance
of the proposal. In granting a partial waiver, in addition to complying
with the requirements in DFARS <a class="xref file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.403-1.ditaxref:3;70:41 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_PART_215.html#DFARS_215.403-1">215.403-1</a>(c)(4), the head of
the contracting activity must address why it is in the Government’s
best interests to grant a partial waiver, given that the offeror
has no objection to certifying to the balance of its cost proposal.</p>

or services</em>. Because there is no price, unpriced supplies or
services cannot be subject to cost or pricing data certification
requirements. The Government cannot agree in advance to waive certification
requirements for unpriced supplies or services, and may only consider
a waiver at such time as an offeror proposes a price that would
otherwise be subject to certification requirements.</p>
