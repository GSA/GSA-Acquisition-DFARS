         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.7303-3.ditap:1;14:52 List1">(a) When a cyber incident is reported by a contractor, the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) will send an unclassified encrypted email containing the cyber incident report to the contracting officer(s) identified on the Incident Collection Format (ICF). The DC3 may request the contracting officer send a digitally signed e-mail to DC3.</p>

In cases where an administrative contracting officer (ACO) receives the cyber incident report, in lieu of the PCO, the ACO shall notify the PCO for each affected contract, who will then notify the requiring activity.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.7303-3.ditap:3;16:52 List2">(2) In cases of cyber incidents involving multiple contracts, the DoD components will collaboratively designate a single contracting officer to coordinate additional actions required of the contractor, on behalf of the affected DoD components. The requiring activity will notify the contracting officer once a lead is designated. </p>

The contracting officer should never receive malicious software directly from the contractor. </p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.7303-3.ditap:9;25:52 List1">(c) If the requiring activity requests access to contractor information or equipment, in accordance with DFARS <a class="xref file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.7303-3.ditaxref:2;28:63 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_PART_252.html#DFARS_252.204-7012">252.204-7012</a>(f), the contracting officer shall provide a written request to the contractor.</p>
