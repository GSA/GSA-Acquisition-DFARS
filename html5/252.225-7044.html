               manufacture of the construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of all
               iron or steel components not produced in the United States, excluding COTS fasteners.
               Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the
               construction material contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials
               used in such construction material is calculated in accordance with the definition of
               “cost of components” in this clause. </p>

               combination of both” means that the cost of the iron and steel content exceeds 50
               percent of the total cost of all its components. The cost of iron and steel is the
               cost of the iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or
               sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good
