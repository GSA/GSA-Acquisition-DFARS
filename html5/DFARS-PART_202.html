obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related
to the item(s) being purchased and are integral to the deliverable
of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale,
the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce
in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being
sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified
period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS
contract.</p>

or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly
related to the specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral
to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of
a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain
manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials,
or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment
required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road
or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects
that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said
contract (e.g., a project to develop or advance a capability, technology
transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may
be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.</p>
