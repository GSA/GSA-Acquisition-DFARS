The first is the presentation of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor. The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the contractor’s presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-finding proceeding concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent that the proposed action stems from the contractor’s affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.</p>

Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending official or designee to provide information as to the contractor’s present responsibility.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/Appendix-id2064F0S0OKP.ditap:2;15:52 List1">(b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor’s behalf; individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.</p>

If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and suspending official.</p>
