         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/232.072-3.ditap:1;8:33 List1">(a)  A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to perform the contract.  When there is doubt regarding the sufficiency of a contractor’s cash flow, the contracting officer should require the contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the contract.</p>
         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/232.072-3.ditap:2;9:33 List1">(b)  A contractor’s inability or refusal to prepare and provide cash flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential contract cost or performance problems.</p>

As such, they should be limited to preaward survey situations.  Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only by comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.</p>
