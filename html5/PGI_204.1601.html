Components are encouraged to transition to the Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID) numbering schema as soon as possible, but no later than the date specified at DFARS <a class="xref file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditaxref:1;17:55 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_PART_204.html#DFARS_204.1601">204.1601</a>(b).</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:2;18:52 List1">(c)(i) A continued contract is issued solely for administrative reasons. When issuing a continued contract, the contracting officer shall perform the following tasks:</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:3;19:52 List4">(A) Obtain approval at a level above the contracting officer before issuance of the continued contract.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:4;20:52 List4">(B) Assign a PIID to the continued contract that is different from the PIID assigned to the predecessor contract, using the uniform PIID numbering system prescribed in FAR 4.1603 and DFARS <a class="xref file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditaxref:2;23:55 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_PART_204.html#DFARS_204.1603">204.1603</a>. The predecessor contract will retain the PIID originally assigned to it.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:5;24:52 List4">(C) Find a clear breaking point (e.g., between issuance of orders, exercise of options, or establishment of a new line of accounting) to issue the continued contract.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:6;25:52 List4">(D) Clearly segregate contractual requirements for purposes of Government inspection, acceptance, payment, and closeout. Supplies already delivered and services already performed under the predecessor contract will remain under the predecessor contract. This will allow the predecessor contract to be closed out when all inspection, acceptance, payment, and other closeout issues associated with supplies delivered and services performed under the predecessor contract are complete.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:7;26:52 List4">(E) Include in the continued contract all terms and conditions of the predecessor contract that pertain to the supplies and services yet to be delivered or performed. At the time it is issued, the continued contract may not in any way alter the prices or terms and conditions established in the predecessor contract.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:8;27:52 List4">(F) Provide advance notice to the contractor before issuance of the continued contract, to include the PIID and the effective date of the continued contract.</p>

         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_204.1601.ditap:14;33:52 List3">(ii) Sample language for the administrative modification to the predecessor contract follows:</p>
