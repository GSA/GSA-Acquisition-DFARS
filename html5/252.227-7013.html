or process data” means technical data that describe the steps, sequences,
and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by
the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a
process.</p>

an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the
item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced.
Workability is generally established when the item, component, or
process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate
to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is
a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how
much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process,
and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item,
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be
offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the
item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within
the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.</p>

price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary
to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether
development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</p>

data” means technical data that describes the required overall physical,
functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification
requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to
the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and
functionally interchangeable items.</p>
         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/252.227-7013.ditap:19;94:45 List2" id="DFARS_252.227-7013__JhjVUU">(12) “Government purpose”
means any activity in which the United States Government is a party,
including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national
defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States
