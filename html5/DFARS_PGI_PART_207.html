must consider whether a contract is likely to be performed in crisis
situations outside the United States and must develop appropriately
detailed measures for inclusion in the contract. Combatant commanders
establish operational plans identifying essential services that
must continue during crisis. DoDI 1100.22 requires Combatant Commanders
to develop contingency plans if they have a reasonable doubt that
a contractor will continue to provide essential services during
a mobilization or crisis. When planning the acquisition, consider
these operational plans and the resources available to carry out
these plans.</p>

“integrated planning” will be described in operation plans (OPLAN),
operation orders (OPORD) or separate annexes, and must be incorporated

entry, country clearance, use of weapons, living on-base, etc. Therefore,
the requiring activity is responsible for obtaining pertinent OPLANs,

activity to confirm that the appropriate personnel department has
determined that inherently Governmental functions are not included

Governmental during a time of crisis, ensure that the contract states
that work will be removed from the contract (temporarily or permanently)
upon the occurrence of a triggering event (specified in the contract)
or upon notice from the contracting officer that informs the contractor
when its responsibility to perform affected duties will stop or
