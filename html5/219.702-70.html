with 15 U.S.C. 637 note, DoD has established a test program to determine

or plant-wide basis will reduce administrative burdens while enhancing
subcontracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business
concerns.</p>

its approved subcontracting goal(s), the contracting officer shall
give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising
of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, permitting
the contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been
made, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period
at the contracting officer’s discretion) within which to respond.
The contracting officer may take the contractor’s failure to respond
to the notice as an admission that no valid explanation exists.</p>

information, the contracting officer determines that the contractor
failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive
subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final
decision. The contracting officer’s final decision shall include
the right of the contractor to appeal under the Disputes clause. The
contracting officer shall distribute a copy of the final decision
to all cognizant contracting officers for the contracts covered
under the plan.</p>
