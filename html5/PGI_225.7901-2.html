that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental
research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions
may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded
fundamental research that has not received national security classification,
except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts
confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research
generally do not involve any export-controlled items, as defined
in paragraph (a) of the clause at DFARS <a class="xref file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_225.7901-2.ditaxref:4;128:41 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_PART_252.html#DFARS_252.225-7048">252.225-7048</a>.</p>

over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research, whether basic,
fundamental, or applied, from statutes that apply to export controls
such as the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act
of 1979, as amended, or the U.S. International Emergency Economic
Powers Act, or the regulations that implement those statutes (the
ITAR and the EAR). Thus, if export-controlled items are used to
conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts,
the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.</p>
