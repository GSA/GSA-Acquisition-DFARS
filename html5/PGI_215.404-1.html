what data is required and why it is needed to determine fair and reasonable
prices, and should be flexible in requesting data in existing formats with
appropriate explanations from the offeror.</p>

15.304 and 42.1502 and the DoD Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance
Information, Version 3, dated May 2003, the contracting officer <span class="ph Revised October 28, 2022 file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.404-1.dita ph:2;46:100">shall, unless exempted by the HCA,</span> provide

or services that are not subject to TINA may require a cost analysis (see
paragraph <span class="ph Revised October 28, 2022 file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.404-1.dita ph:3;51:46">(c)</span> of this section). This
will occur when a price analysis is not sufficient for determining prices to be
fair and reasonable. In such cases, the contracting officer should consider the
need for a Defense Contract Audit Agency audit of the cost data.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.404-1.dita p:14;55:52 List4">(C) Particular attention should be paid
to sole source commercial supplies or services. While the order
of preference at FAR
15.402 must be followed, if the contracting officer cannot
determine price reasonableness without obtaining data other than
cost or pricing data from the offeror, at a minimum, the contracting
officer must obtain appropriate data on the prices at which the
same or similar items have been sold previously (often previous
sales data was the basis of the commercial item determination and
must be requested during price analysis of the data provided by
the offeror). If previous sales data is not sufficient to determine
price reasonableness, the contracting officer must obtain “data
other than certified cost or pricing data” and, if necessary, perform
a cost analysis.</p>
         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.404-1.dita p:15;69:52 List4">(D) Analysis of termination proposals,
including termination of any contract scope, should not rely solely
on earned value management budgets or estimates for estimating the
costs of all work deleted, or the cost of deleted work already performed
(reference FAR Subpart 15.4,
Table 15-2—Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When
Certified Cost or Pricing Data are Required, columns (2) and (3)
of section III.B., Change Orders, Modifications, and Claims).</p>

         <p class="p file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.404-1.dita p:18;87:52 List3">(v) Contracting officers must
obtain and document sufficient data to confirm that previous prices paid by the
Government were based on a thorough price and/or cost analysis. For example, it
would not be sufficient to use price(s) from a database paid by another
contracting officer without understanding the type of analysis that was
performed to determine the <span class="ph Revised October 28, 2022 file:/C:/GSA_Regs/GSA-Acquisition-DFARS/dita/PGI_215.404-1.dita ph:4;92:63">reasonableness of
the price(s),</span> and without verifying that the quantities were similar for
pricing purposes. This does not necessarily need to be another analysis, but
there should be coordination with the other office that acknowledges an analysis
was performed previously.</p>

assistance is particularly important when evaluating pricing related to items
that are “similar to” items being purchased or commercial items that are “of a
type” or require “minor modifications.” Technical analysis can assist in pricing
these types of items by identifying any differences between the item being
acquired and the “similar to” item. In particular, the technical review can
assist in evaluating the changes that are required to get from the “similar to”
item, to the item being solicited, so the contracting officer can determine
sufficient price/cost analysis techniques when evaluating that the price for the
item being solicited is fair and reasonable. See the Department of Defense
