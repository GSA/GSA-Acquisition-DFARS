at FAR 15.304 and
42.1502 and the DoD Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance
Information, Version 3, dated May 2003, the contracting officer
shall provide input into the past performance system, noting the
offeror’s refusal to provide the requested information.</p>
         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/PGI_215.404-1.ditap:13;46:33 List4">(B) In some cases, supplies or services
that are not subject to TINA may require a cost analysis (see paragraph
(b)(iv) of this section). This will occur when a price analysis
is not sufficient for determining prices to be fair and reasonable.
In such cases, the contracting officer should consider the need
for a Defense Contract Audit Agency audit of the cost data.</p>
         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/PGI_215.404-1.ditap:14;52:33 List4">(C) Particular attention should be paid
to sole source commercial supplies or services. While the order
of preference at FAR
15.402 must be followed, if the contracting officer cannot
determine price reasonableness without obtaining data other than
cost or pricing data from the offeror, at a minimum, the contracting
officer must obtain appropriate data on the prices at which the
same or similar items have been sold previously (often previous
sales data was the basis of the commercial item determination and
must be requested during price analysis of the data provided by
the offeror). If previous sales data is not sufficient to determine
price reasonableness, the contracting officer must obtain “data
other than certified cost or pricing data” and, if necessary, perform
a cost analysis.</p>
         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/PGI_215.404-1.ditap:15;66:33 List4">(D) Analysis of termination proposals,
including termination of any contract scope, should not rely solely
on earned value management budgets or estimates for estimating the
costs of all work deleted, or the cost of deleted work already performed
(reference FAR Subpart 15.4,
Table 15-2—Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When
Certified Cost or Pricing Data are Required, columns (2) and (3)
of section III.B., Change Orders, Modifications, and Claims).</p>

document sufficient data to confirm that previous prices paid by
the Government were based on a thorough price and/or cost analysis.
For example, it would not be sufficient to use price(s) from a database
paid by another contracting officer without understanding the type
of analysis that was performed to determine the price(s), and without
verifying that the quantities were similar for pricing purposes.
This does not necessarily need to be another analysis, but there
should be coordination with the other office that acknowledges an analysis
was performed previously.</p>

evaluating pricing related to items that are “similar to” items being
purchased or commercial items that are “of a type” or require “minor
modifications.” Technical analysis can assist in pricing these types
of items by identifying any differences between the item being acquired
and the “similar to” item. In particular, the technical review can
assist in evaluating the changes that are required to get from the
“similar to” item, to the item being solicited, so the contracting
officer can determine sufficient price/cost analysis techniques
when evaluating that the price for the item being solicited is fair
and reasonable. See the Department of Defense Guidebook for Acquiring
