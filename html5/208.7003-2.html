Under this exception, the military departments may contract for research and development requirements, including quantities for testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in actual production, but beyond prototype).  Generally, this exception applies only when research and development funds are used.</p>

For use of this exception, it must be clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the acquisition to the acquiring department.  Anticipation that contracting by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason for using this exception.</p>

This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.</p>
         <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DFARS/Dfars_Fixed/dita/208.7003-2.ditap:20;29:33 List2">(2)  This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.</p>
