         <p class="p List2">(1)  A basic principle of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System is that, upon contract award, contractors bring all the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, property, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them (reference <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 9.104-1</span> (e), (f), and (g) of General Standards).  Therefore, upon contract award, responsible contractors should have the means to provide effective and efficient stewardship of Government property.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Government property, as defined at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.101</span>, must be contractually accountable to a single contract and only one contract at a time. This requirement applies to both Government-furnished property and contractor-acquired property.  Although accountable to only one contract at a time, contract terms and conditions may allow Government property to be used on other contracts (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 52.245-9</span>, Use and Charges).</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The requiring activity (project or program manager, or purchase request generator), as part of its responsibility for acquisition planning (FAR part 7, Acquisition Planning), is the decision point as to whether or not to furnish property to contractors.  The basis for any decision to provide Government property shall be documented by the requiring activity and provided to the contracting officer.  Such documentation is not required when contractors are furnished property for repair, modification, or overhaul under a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Prior to furnishing Government property to the contractor, the contracting officer shall ensure that each of the requirements of <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.102</span> are addressed as follows, and documented in the contracting file—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Element 1: In the Government’s best interest.</em> Discussion should be specific, factual, and where necessary, address actual or projected dollars and percentages.  Merely selecting one or two objectives supported by a general, perfunctory discussion does not address this element satisfactorily.  Discussion should address the following factors:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Economy – Furnishing Government property is the lowest cost or price alternative.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Standardization – There is a critical need for precise replication.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Security – Government property is needed due to national security issues/concerns.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Expedite production – Government property is crucial to achieving timely or accelerated delivery of a supply item or service.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Scarcity – The Government can obtain scarce items, or is the only source of property necessary for successful execution of a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Maintain the industrial base – Government property is needed to ensure future capability to obtain a particular supply item or service.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Contract type – Government property will enable the Government to obtain a more favorable contract type.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Element 2</em>:  <em class="ph i">Overall benefit.</em>Demonstrate that the overall benefit to the acquisition significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including property disposal.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Property in the hands of contractors drives program costs.  Therefore, in order to make the case that providing Government property to the contractor is worthwhile, the associated costs must be considered and the business decision justified.  The costs of Government property removal and disposal, including demilitarization and disposal of environmentally-regulated property, must be included.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Costs must be either less than what the contractor might otherwise incur, or the demonstrated benefit to the Government must outweigh these additional contract costs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  <em class="ph i">Element 3:  Government assumption of risk.</em>  Demonstrate that providing the property does not substantially increase the Government’s risk.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Risk must be discussed and documented.  A risk analysis is warranted to demonstrate that the Government is not substantially increasing its risk.  For example, when furnishing Government property, the Government is ordinarily responsible for suitability of use, timely delivery, and replacement of defective Government property.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Other risks may need to be considered, discussed, and documented.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  <em class="ph i">Element 4:  Government requirements cannot otherwise be met</em>.  Document why the furnishing of Government property is critical and significant to meeting acquisition plan objectives.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(9)  If the Attorney General advises that the proposed disposition is inconsistent with the antitrust laws, do not continue with the proposed disposition.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(10)  Under noncompetitive sales, the prospective purchaser shall be informed that final consummation of the sale is subject to determination by the Attorney General.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(11)  The disposal of contractor inventory is the responsibility of the contractor.  However, the disposal/sales services of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services or a Federal agency, e.g., GSA, may be used in unusual or compelling circumstances, as determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Government, and provided DLA Disposition Services/the agency agrees.  In such cases, disposal/sales services may be provided on a reimbursable basis, with any sale proceeds credited in compliance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.604-4</span>, Proceeds from sales of surplus property.  If sale services are needed, the plant clearance officer will document the reasons in the case file and make arrangements directly with DLA Disposition Services, GSA, other Federal agency, or third-party.  The arrangements will include a requirement to return all proceeds to the plant clearance officer for crediting in compliance with<span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.604-4</span>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(12)  The PLCO shall, prior to sales contract award—</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS-PGI_PGI_245.602-70__i1348373">(i)  Ensure the prospective buyer is not an ineligible transferee, including those on found in the System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions.  For additional information see https://www.acquisition.gov ;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Cross-reference contractor inventory to a National Stock Number and Demilitarization code.  For additional information, see FED LOG or WEBFLIS at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/webflis/ and the current edition of the DoD Demilitarization Manual at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives; </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Consult with the DoD Demilitarization (Demil)/Trade Security Control (TSC) Program office to determine if the contractor inventory can be sold to the public; and if a TSC assessment of the prospective buyer is required.  Reference DoD Instruction 2030.08, Implementation of Trade Security Controls (TSC) for Transfers of DoD U.S. Munitions List (USML) and Commerce Control List (CCL) Personal Property to Parties Outside DoD Control; and Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.28-M;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  If TSC is required, provide the DoD Demil/TSC Program office with a completed DLA Form 1822 End-Use Certificate (EUC) for the prospective buyer.  Note: TSC assessments/EUCs are typically not required for scrap sales; and </p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  Upon TSC clearance (if required) of the prospective buyer, authorize the contractor to complete the sale, as applicable. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(13)  To the extent that demilitarization, mutilation, or destruction is required, the PLCO may authorize the contractor to perform such action as follows: </p>

         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Such other actions as are included in the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(14)  Security assistance transfers or foreign military sales shall be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and consistent with DoD 5105.38-M Security Assistance Management Manual.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(15)  The plant clearance officer may send a notice of proposed surplus sale to FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) if the items have potentially high public interest.</p>
