         <p class="p List2">(1)  This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item.  This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.</p>

It is not intended to recategorize current noncommercial items, however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from business segments that meet the definition of “nontraditional defense contractor” even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors.  The decision to apply commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial item determination and does not mean the item is commercial. </p>

reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer
is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference

to supply information that is sufficient to determine the reasonableness
of price, regardless of whether or not the contractor was required to
provide such information in connection with any earlier procurement.
If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information
submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price,
the contracting officer may request other relevant information regarding
the basis for price or cost, including uncertified cost data such
as labor costs, material costs, and other direct and indirect costs.</p>
