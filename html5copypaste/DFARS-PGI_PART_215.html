         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracting officers must purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. The Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA) (10 U.S.C. 2306a and 41 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires offerors to submit certified cost or pricing data if a procurement exceeds the TINA threshold and none of the exceptions to certified cost or pricing data requirements applies. Under TINA, the contracting officer obtains accurate, complete, and current data from offerors to establish a fair and reasonable price (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.403</span>). TINA also allows for a price adjustment remedy if it is later found that a contractor did not provide accurate, complete, and current data.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) When certified cost or pricing data are not required, and the contracting officer does not have sufficient data to determine price reasonableness, <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.402</span>(a)(2) requires the offeror to provide whatever data the contracting officer needs in order to determine fair and reasonable prices.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Obtaining sufficient data from the offeror is particularly critical in situations where an item is determined to be a commercial item in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 2.101</span>and the contract is being awarded on a sole source basis. This includes commercial sales data of items sold in similar quantities and, if such data is insufficient, cost data to support the proposed price.</p>

         <p class="p List6">(1) Contract number, including modification number, if applicable, and program name.</p>

         <p class="p List6">(6) Brief description of the specific steps taken to ensure price reasonableness.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) <em class="ph i">Pricing Actions Reported</em>. The intent of this requirement is to report when a commercial item exception was determined. Therefore, the reporting of the commercial item exceptions are for pricing actions at the point the contracting officer makes a determination that the commercial item exception applies. For example—</p>
         <p class="p">Example 1: The contracting officer determined that a commercial item exception applies for an entire indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract and expected the subsequent orders to exceed $19.5 million (based on the estimated maximum amount for the IDIQ or other supportable estimate of future orders). The organization would report this in accordance with DFARS 215.403-1(c)(3) for the period in which the IDIQ contract was awarded, and would include the total dollar amount of subsequent orders under the exception expected at the time of award. </p>
         <p class="p">Example 2: The contracting officer awards an IDIQ contract with no commercial item exceptions anticipated. The contracting officer later modifies the contract for an order that will meet commercial item exceptions, and the subsequent order(s) are expected to exceed $19.5 million. Reporting (in the year the modification was issued) will include this IDIQ contract, the amount of this order, and any other expected future orders that will use the exception.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) For the above examples, after the contract is reported as receiving the exception with expected awards over $19.5 million, there would be no further report, e.g., when a subsequent order under that contract exceeds $19.5 million, because reporting for that contract was already accomplished.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) When explaining price reasonableness in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(B)<em class="ph i">(1)</em>(6) of this subsection, if pricing was accomplished when the IDIQ contract was awarded, also explain how price reasonableness was determined. In circumstances where pricing will take place on the order at a future date, explain how pricing techniques at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.404-1</span> will be used, including obtaining cost data, if that is the only way to determine price reasonableness.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Waivers</em>. </p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) <em class="ph i">Exceptional case TINA waiver</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) In determining that an exceptional case TINA waiver is appropriate, the head of the contracting activity must exercise care to ensure that the supplies or services could not be obtained without the waiver and that the determination is clearly documented. See DPAP March 23, 2007, policy memorandum. The intent is not to relieve entities that normally perform Government contracts subject to TINA from an obligation to certify that cost or pricing data are accurate, complete, and current. Instead, waivers must be used judiciously, in situations where the Government could not otherwise obtain a needed item without a waiver. A prime example would be when a particular company offers an item that is essential to DoD’s mission but is not available from other sources, and the company refuses to submit certified cost or pricing data. In such cases, a waiver may be appropriate. However, the procuring agency should, in conjunction with the waiver, develop a strategy for procuring the item in the future that will not require such a waiver (e.g., develop a second source, develop an alternative product that satisfies the department’s needs, or have DoD produce the item).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) <em class="ph i">Senior procurement executive coordination</em>. An exceptional case TINA waiver that exceeds $100 million shall be coordinated with the senior procurement executive prior to granting the waiver. </p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) <em class="ph i">Waiver for part of a proposal</em>. The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data may be waived for part of an offeror’s proposed price when it is possible to clearly identify that part of the offeror’s cost proposal to which the waiver applies as separate and distinct from the balance of the proposal. In granting a partial waiver, in addition to complying with the requirements in DFARS 215.403-1(c)(4), the head of the contracting activity must address why it is in the Government’s best interests to grant a partial waiver, given that the offeror has no objection to certifying to the balance of its cost proposal.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) <em class="ph i">Waivers for unpriced supplies or services</em>. Because there is no price, unpriced supplies or services cannot be subject to cost or pricing data certification requirements. The Government cannot agree in advance to waive certification requirements for unpriced supplies or services, and may only consider a waiver at such time as an offeror proposes a price that would otherwise be subject to certification requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The annual report of waiver of TINA requirements shall include the following:</p>
         <p class="p">Title: Waiver of TINA Requirements</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1) Contract number, including modification number, if applicable, and program name.</p>

         <p class="p List6">(6) Brief description of the specific steps taken to ensure price reasonableness.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">General</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The objective of proposal analysis is to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable. </p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) When the contracting officer needs data to determine price reasonableness and the offeror will not furnish that data, use the following sequence of steps to resolve the issue:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) The contracting officer should make it clear what data is required and why it is needed to determine fair and reasonable prices, and should be flexible in requesting data in existing formats with appropriate explanations from the offeror.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) If the offeror refuses to provide the data, the contracting officer should elevate the issue within the contracting activity.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) Contracting activity management shall, with support from the contracting officer, discuss the issue with appropriate levels of the offeror’s management.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) If the offeror continues to refuse to provide the data, contracting activity management shall elevate the issue to the head of the contracting activity for a decision in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.403-3</span>(a)(4).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">v</em>) The contracting officer shall document the contract file to describe—</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">a</em>) The data requested and the contracting officer’s need for that data;</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">b</em>) Why there is currently no other alternative but to procure the item from this particular source; and</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">c</em>) A written plan for avoiding this situation in the future (e.g., develop a second source by...; bring the procurement in house to the Government by...).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">vi</em>) Consistent with the requirements at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.304</span> and 42.1502 and the DoD Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance Information, Version 3, dated May 2003, the contracting officer shall provide input into the past performance system, noting the offeror’s refusal to provide the requested information.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) In some cases, supplies or services that are not subject to TINA may require a cost analysis (see paragraph (b)(iv) of this section). This will occur when a price analysis is not sufficient for determining prices to be fair and reasonable. In such cases, the contracting officer should consider the need for a Defense Contract Audit Agency audit of the cost data.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Particular attention should be paid to sole source commercial supplies or services. While the order of preference at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.402</span> must be followed, if the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness without obtaining data other than cost or pricing data from the offeror, at a minimum, the contracting officer must obtain appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously (often previous sales data was the basis of the commercial item determination and must be requested during price analysis of the data provided by the offeror). If previous sales data is not sufficient to determine price reasonableness, the contracting officer must obtain “data other than certified cost or pricing data” and, if necessary, perform a cost analysis.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Analysis of termination proposals, including termination of any contract scope, should not rely solely on earned value management budgets or estimates for estimating the costs of all work deleted, or the cost of deleted work already performed (reference FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">15.4</span>, Table 15-2—Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing Data are Required, columns (2) and (3) of section III.B., Change Orders, Modifications, and Claims).</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) See the Department of Defense Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items, Part B: Pricing Commercial Items, for detailed guidance about techniques and approaches to pricing commercial products and services.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Contracting officers must obtain and document sufficient data to confirm that previous prices paid by the Government were based on a thorough price and/or cost analysis. For example, it would not be sufficient to use price(s) from a database paid by another contracting officer without understanding the type of analysis that was performed to determine the price(s), and without verifying that the quantities were similar for pricing purposes. This does not necessarily need to be another analysis, but there should be coordination with the other office that acknowledges an analysis was performed previously.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Cost analysis</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) When the contracting officer cannot obtain sufficient data to perform a price analysis in accordance with the pricing steps in <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.404-1</span>(b), a cost analysis is required.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When a solicitation is not subject to TINA and a cost analysis is required, the contracting officer must clearly communicate to the offeror the cost data that will be needed to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) To the extent possible, when cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted in accordance with Table 15-2 of <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.408</span>, the contracting officer should accept the cost data in a format consistent with the offeror’s records.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The contracting officer must always consider the need for field pricing support from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other agencies.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Technical analysis</em>.</p>
         <p class="p">Requesting technical assistance is particularly important when evaluating pricing related to items that are “similar to” items being purchased or commercial items that are “of a type” or require “minor modifications.” Technical analysis can assist in pricing these types of items by identifying any differences between the item being acquired and the “similar to” item. In particular, the technical review can assist in evaluating the changes that are required to get from the “similar to” item, to the item being solicited, so the contracting officer can determine sufficient price/cost analysis techniques when evaluating that the price for the item being solicited is fair and reasonable. See the Department of Defense Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items, Part B: Pricing Commercial Items, for information about how to obtain advisory assistance from the DoD cadre of experts in the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) Commercial Item Group (CIG) via email at commercial@dcma.mil or at http://www.dcma.mil/commercial-item-group/.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) The contracting officer should consider the need for field pricing analysis and evaluation of lower-tier subcontractor proposals, and assistance to prime contractors when they are being denied access to lower-tier subcontractor records.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) When obtaining field pricing assistance on a prime contractor’s proposal, the contracting officer should request audit or field pricing assistance to analyze and evaluate the proposal of a subcontractor at any tier (notwithstanding availability of data or analyses performed by the prime contractor) if the contracting officer believes that such assistance is necessary to ensure the reasonableness of the total proposed price. Such assistance may be appropriate when, for example¾</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) There is a business relationship between the contractor and the subcontractor not conducive to independence and objectivity;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The contractor is a sole source supplier and the subcontract costs represent a substantial part of the contract cost;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The contractor has been denied access to the subcontractor’s records;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) The contracting officer determines that, because of factors such as the size of the proposed subcontract price, audit or field pricing assistance for a subcontract at any tier is critical to a fully detailed analysis of the prime contractor’s proposal;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) The contractor or higher-tier subcontractor has been cited for having significant estimating system deficiencies in the area of subcontract pricing, especially the failure to perform adequate cost analyses of proposed subcontract costs or to perform subcontract analyses prior to negotiation of the prime contract with the Government; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) A lower-tier subcontractor has been cited as having significant estimating system deficiencies.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) It may be appropriate for the contracting officer or the ACO to provide assistance to a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, when the contractor or higher-tier subcontractor has been denied access to a subcontractor’s records in carrying out the responsibilities at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.404-3</span> to conduct price or cost analysis to determine the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices. Under these circumstances, the contracting officer or the ACO should consider whether providing audit or field pricing assistance will serve a valid Government interest.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When DoD performs the subcontract analysis, DoD shall furnish to the prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor, with the consent of the subcontractor reviewed, a summary of the analysis performed in determining any unacceptable costs included in the subcontract proposal.

         <p class="p List3">(iv) Price redeterminable or fixed-price incentive contracts may include subcontracts placed on the same basis. When the contracting officer wants to reprice the prime contract even though the contractor has not yet established final prices for the subcontracts, the contracting officer may negotiate a firm contract price—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(11) The contracting officer is responsible to ensure the approved pre- and postnegotiation noncompetitive business clearance documents (e.g., price negotiation memoranda) are uploaded into the Contract Business Analysis Repository (CBAR) at https://eadf.dcma.mil/ewam2/registration/setup.do for the purpose of sharing negotiation experience with other contracting officers preparing to negotiate. This includes both noncompetitive actions using the procedures at FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, as well as noncompetitive actions using the procedures at FAR part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, that are valued in excess of $25 million and awarded on or after June 24, 2013 (and for all definitized or awarded actions over $100 million, which occurred on or after October 1, 2012).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Business clearance documents uploaded to CBAR shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)" at the top and bottom of the face or cover page, and on the bottom of each page containing FOUO, including the back page or cover.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The business clearance documents uploaded to CBAR shall be signed by the contracting officer and shall include all other signatures required by local policy/procedure.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The documentation shall be uploaded to CBAR no later than 30 days after award of the contract action associated with the negotiation and shall include both the prenegotiation objectives required by <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.406-1</span> and PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">

Additionally, the contracting officer shall complete the “comments” field of the CBAR record to summarize unique features and aspects of the negotiation in order to prompt other contracting teams to inquire further to learn from their peers’ prior experience.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) If an initial indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) task or delivery order contract contemplates issuance of task or delivery orders that will invoke negotiated rates or values from the basic contract, then the business clearance record for the basic IDIQ contract shall be uploaded if the estimated value of the contract (e.g. ceiling price) exceeds the prescribed dollar threshold. To the extent individual task or delivery orders entail a negotiation (i.e. did not simply incorporate prices established at the basic contract level), a business clearance record for the individual task or delivery orders that exceed the prescribed dollar thresholds shall be uploaded to CBAR. </p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)(A) DCMA or the military department responsible for performing contract administration functions (e.g., Navy SUPSHIP) should consider, based on risk assessment, performing an overhead should-cost review of a contractor business unit (as defined in <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 2.101</span>) when all of the following conditions exist:</p>

         <p class="p List4">(B) The head of the contracting activity may request an overhead should-cost review for a business unit that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(A) of this subsection.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Overhead should-cost reviews are labor intensive. These reviews generally involve participation by the contracting, contract administration, and contract audit elements. The extent of availability of military department, contract administration, and contract audit resources to support DCMA-led teams should be considered when determining whether a review will be conducted. Overhead should-cost reviews generally should not be conducted at a contractor business segment more frequently than every 3 years.</p>
