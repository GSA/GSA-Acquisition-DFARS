      <div class="body">
         <p class="p List2">1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sections 7101-7109), (b) pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their duly authorized representative, or (c) pursuant to the provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a Military Department or their authorized representative has granted a right of appeal not contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other departments and agencies by agreement as permitted by law. The Board shall operate under general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition and may perform other duties as directed not inconsistent with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The Board shall decide the matters before it independently.</p>
         <p class="p List2">2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Appointment of Board members shall be made by the Secretary of Defense. Members of the Board are hereby designated Administrative Judges. There shall be designated from among the appointed Judges of the Board a Chairman and two or more Vice Chairmen. Designation of the Chairman and Vice Chairmen shall be made by the Secretary of Defense, of nominees from Judges of the Board recommended by the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition, in coordination with the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition. When there is a vacancy, the incumbent is unavailable, or for appropriate Board administrative reasons, the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition or the Chairman may designate a Judge of the Board to serve as an Acting Chairman or Acting Vice Chairman.</p>
         <p class="p List2">3. The Chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman shall have authority to establish procedures for the issuance of Board decisions. The Chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision process for decision by a Senior Deciding Group established by the Chairman which shall have the authority to overturn prior Board precedent.</p>
         <p class="p List2">4. It shall be the duty and obligation of the Judges of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation pertinent thereto.</p>
         <p class="p List2">5. Any Judge of the Board or any examiner, designated by the Chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and receive evidence and argument. A Judge of the Board shall have authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. In cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chairman may request orders of the court in the manner prescribed in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p>
         <p class="p List2">6. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the proper performance of its duties. The Board has the authority to issue methods of procedure and rules and regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of appeals and issuance of opinions.</p>
         <p class="p List2">7. The Chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization of the Board and for its administration. The Chairman shall provide within approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-Judge personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the performance of the functions of the Board. The Chairman shall appoint a Recorder of the Board. All personnel shall be responsible to and shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Chairman.</p>
         <p class="p List2">8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for administrative support as required for its operations. Administrative support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower control and utilization, personnel administration, security administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense will participate in financing the Board’s operations on an equal basis and to the extent determined by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be reimbursed.</p>
         <p class="p List2">9. Within 30 days following the close of a fiscal year, the Chairman shall forward a report of the Board’s transactions and proceedings for the preceding fiscal year to the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition.</p>
         <p class="p List2">10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: “Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.” This seal shall be affixed to all authentications of copies of records and to such other instruments as the Board may determine.</p>

      <h6 class="title topictitle6" id="ariaid-title8">II. LOCATION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD</h6>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The Board’s address is Skyline Six, Room 703, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 220413208; telephone 703–681–8500 (general), 703–681–8502 (Recorder).

         <p class="p List1">(b) The Board consists of a Chairman, two or more Vice Chairmen, and other Members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. Board Members are designated Administrative Judges.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) There are a number of divisions of the Board, established by the Chairman in such manner as to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals.

Except for appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure (see Rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(c)), the decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the Board, unless the Chairman refers the appeal to the Board’s Senior Deciding Group (consisting of the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, all division heads, and the Judge who drafted the decision), in which event a decision of a majority of that group constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty or significant precedential importance, or that have occasioned serious dispute within the normal division decision process.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The Board will to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.</p>

      <h6 class="title topictitle6" id="ariaid-title10">Rule 1. Appeals</h6>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Taking an Appeal—For appeals subject to the Contract Disputes Act, notice of an appeal shall be in writing and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer’s decision. The appellant (contractor) should also furnish a copy of the notice of appeal to the contracting officer. For appeals not subject to the Contract Disputes Act, the contractor should refer to the Disputes clause in its contract for the time period in which it must file a notice of appeal.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $100,000 or less to the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not provided a decision within that period, or where such a contractor request has not been made and the contracting officer has not issued a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim over $100,000 to the contracting officer or has submitted a claim that involves no monetary amount, and the contracting officer, within 60 days of receipt of the claim, fails to issue a decision or fails to provide the contractor with a reasonable date by which a decision will be issued, and the contracting officer has failed to issue a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) A reasonable time shall be determined by taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information provided by the contractor to support the claim.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Where an appeal is before the Board pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of time as is determined by the Board.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the contractor may petition the Board to direct the contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time as determined by the Board.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Contents of Notice of Appeal—A notice of appeal shall indicate that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract by number, the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if any. A copy of the contracting officer’s final decision, if any, should be attached to the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal should be signed by the appellant or by the appellant’s duly authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in Rule 6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the requirements of a complaint.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Docketing of Appeal—When a notice of appeal has been received by the Board, it will be docketed. The Board will provide a written notice of docketing to the appellant and to the Government.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Duties of the Government—Within 30 days of notice that an appeal has been filed, the Government shall transmit to the Board and the appellant an appeal file consisting of the documents the Government considers relevant to the appeal, including:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The decision from which the appeal is taken;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, plans, and drawings;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, including any claim in response to which the decision was issued.</p>
         <p class="p">The Government’s appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Duties of the Appellant—Within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the Government’s appeal file, the appellant shall transmit to the Board and the Government any documents not contained therein that the appellant considers relevant to the appeal. Appellant’s appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Organization of Appeal File—Documents in the appeal file may be originals or legible copies, and shall be arranged in chronological order where practicable, tabbed with sequential numbers, and indexed to identify the contents of the file. Any document without internal page numbers shall have page numbers added. All documents must be in English or include an English translation. Documents shall be submitted in 3-ring binders, with spines not wider than 3 inches wide, with labels identifying the name of the appeal, ASBCA number and tab numbers contained in each volume, on the front and spine of each volume.

         <p class="p List1">(d) Status of Documents in Appeal File—Documents contained in the appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to the admissibility of a particular document reasonably in advance of hearing or, if there is no hearing, of settling the record, or in any case as ordered by the Board. If such objection is made, the Board will constructively remove the document from the appeal file and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as evidence in accordance with Rules 10, 11, and 13.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Appellant—Within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board a complaint setting forth simple, concise, and direct statements of each of its claims. The complaint shall also set forth the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each claim and the dollar amount claimed, if any. This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, although no particular form is required. Should the complaint not be timely received, the appellant’s claim and notice of appeal may be deemed to set forth its complaint if, in the opinion of the Board, the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined, and the parties will be notified.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Government—Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall file with the Board an answer thereto. The answer shall admit or deny the allegations of the complaint and shall set forth simple, concise, and direct statements of the Government’s defenses to each claim asserted by the appellant, including any affirmative defenses. Should the answer not be timely received, the Board may enter a general denial on behalf of the Government, and the parties will be notified.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Foreign Law—A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a foreign country shall give notice in its pleadings or other reasonable written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 10, 11, or 13. The determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Further Pleadings—The Board upon its own initiative or upon motion may order a party to make a more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer. The Board may permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided however, that the objecting party may be granted an opportunity to meet such evidence.</p>

      <h6 class="title topictitle6" id="ariaid-title16">Rule 7. Motions</h6>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Motions Generally—The Board may entertain and rule upon motions and may defer ruling as appropriate. The Board will rule on motions so as to secure, to the fullest extent practicable, the informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of appeals. All motions should be filed as separate documents with an appropriate heading describing the motion. Oral argument on motions is subject to the discretion of the Board.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Jurisdictional Motions—Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board should be promptly filed. An evidentiary hearing to address disputed jurisdictional facts will be afforded on application of either party or by order of the Board. The Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on the merits. The Board may at any time and on its own initiative raise the issue of its jurisdiction, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Summary Judgment Motions—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) To facilitate disposition of such a motion, the parties should adhere to the following procedures. Where the parties agree that disposition by summary judgment or partial summary judgment is appropriate, they may file a stipulation of all material facts necessary for the Board to rule on the motion. Otherwise, the moving party should file with its motion a “Statement of Undisputed Material Facts,” setting forth the claimed undisputed material facts in separate, numbered paragraphs. The non-moving party should file a “Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact,” responding to each numbered paragraph proposed, demonstrating, where appropriate, the existence of material facts in dispute and if appropriate propose additional facts. The moving party and the non-moving party should submit a memorandum of law supporting or opposing summary judgment.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In deciding motions for summary judgment, the Board looks to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance. The parties should explicitly state and support by specific evidence all facts and legal arguments necessary to sustain a party’s position. Each party should cite to the record and attach any additional evidence upon which it relies (e.g., affidavits, declarations, excerpts from depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions). The Board may accept a fact properly proposed and supported by one party as undisputed, unless the opposing party properly responds and establishes that it is in dispute.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Response to Motions—A non-moving party has 30 days from receipt of a motion to file its response, unless a different period is ordered by the Board. A moving party has 30 days from receipt of a non-moving party’s response to file a reply, unless a different period is ordered by the Board.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) General Policy and Protective Orders—The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. Within 45 days after the pleadings have been filed, the parties must confer concerning each party’s discovery needs, including the scheduling of discovery and the production of electronically stored information. Absent stipulation or a Board order, no discovery may be served prior to this conference. Any motion pertaining to a discovery dispute shall include a statement that the movant has in good faith attempted to resolve the discovery dispute without involvement of the Board. In connection with any discovery procedure, the Board may issue orders to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time, and place for discovery, and provisions for governing the disclosure of information or documents. Any discovery under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 16 with respect to sanctions.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Depositions—When Permitted—Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may take, or the Board may upon motion order the taking of, testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The Board expects the parties to make persons under their control available for deposition. The motion for an order shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Depositions—Orders—The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by order of the Board.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Depositions—Use as Evidence—No testimony taken by deposition shall be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent can testify at the hearing. The deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given at a hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the Board may receive depositions to supplement the record.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Depositions—Expenses—Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with the taking of any deposition, absent an agreement by the parties or a Board order to the contrary.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Depositions—Subpoenas—Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 22.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions, Requests for Production—Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may serve, or the Board may upon motion order:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and answered or objected to within 45 days after service;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A request for the admission of specified facts and/or of the authenticity of any documents, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after service, the factual statements and/or the authenticity of the documents to be deemed admitted upon failure of a party to respond to the request; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) A request for the production, inspection, and copying of any documents, electronic or otherwise, or objects, not privileged, which reasonably may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after service. The Board may allow a shorter or longer time.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(c) Nature of Hearings—Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. The parties may offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence or in the sound discretion of the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner. The Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding on the Board but may guide the Board’s rulings. The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness if the witness were present.

Affidavits, declarations, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed in addition to the Rule 4 file if moved and accepted into evidence.

In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the Administrative Judge will sign the subpoena, enter the name of the witness and may otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory may be issued and served under the circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Service—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing may be served in any state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day’s attendance and the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law. However, where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, payment need not be tendered in advance of attendance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for striking such evidence as the Board deems appropriate.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena—In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, the Board may apply to the Court through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board to give testimony or produce evidence or both. Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(d) Standards of awards—A prevailing eligible applicant shall receive an award of fees and expenses incurred in connection with a CDA appeal, unless the position of the Government over which the applicant prevailed was substantially justified, or if special circumstances make the award unjust.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1) Fees and other expenses must be reasonable. Awards will be based upon the prevailing market rates, subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for the kind and quality of services furnished by attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3) When a compliant application has been timely filed, the Board, in order to obtain more detailed information, may require supplementation of the application.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) Net worth exhibit—Each applicant for which a determination of net worth is required under the EAJA should provide with its application a detailed net worth exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant when the CDA appeal was filed. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of assets, liabilities, and net worth.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) Fees and other expenses exhibit—The application should be accompanied by a detailed fees and other expenses exhibit fully documenting the fees and other expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project, for which an award is sought. The date and a description of all services rendered or costs incurred should be indicated. A separate itemized statement should be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application showing the hours spent in connection with the CDA appeal by each individual, a description of the particular services performed by specific date, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The Board may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses sought.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) Answer to application—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Within 30 days after receipt by the Government of an application, the Government may file an answer. Unless the Government requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (2) below, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated by the Board at its discretion as a general denial to the application on behalf of the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the Government and the applicant believe that the matters raised in the application can be resolved by mutual agreement, they may jointly file a statement of intent to negotiate a settlement. Filing of this statement will extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days. Further extensions may be requested by the parties.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The answer will explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied upon in support of the Government's position.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) An original and one copy of the answer should be filed with the Board. The Government will forward one copy to the applicant.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(k) Reply—Within 15 days after receipt of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. An original and one copy of the reply will be filed with the Board. The applicant will forward one copy to the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(l) Award proceedings—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Board may enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate under the EAJA. Further proceedings will be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A request that the Board order further proceedings under this paragraph will describe the disputed issues, explain why the additional proceedings are deemed necessary to resolve the issues and specifically identify any information sought and its relationship to the disputed issues.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(m) Evidence—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Decisions on the merits—When a CDA appeal is decided on the merits, other than by a consent judgment, the record relating to whether the Government's position under the EAJA was substantially justified will be limited to the record in the CDA appeal. Evidence relevant to other issues in the award proceeding may be submitted.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Other dispositions—When a CDA appeal is settled, or decided by a consent judgment, either party in proceedings under the EAJA may, for good cause shown, supplement the record established in the CDA appeal with affidavits and other supporting evidence relating to whether the position of the agency was substantially justified or other issues in the award proceeding.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(n) Decision—Decisions under the EAJA will be rendered by the Administrative Judge or a majority of the judges who would have participated in a motion for reconsideration of the underlying CDA appeal. The decision of the Board will include written findings and conclusions and the basis therefor. The Board's decision on an application for fees and other expenses under the EAJA will be the final administrative decision regarding the EAJA application.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(o) Motions for reconsideration—Either party may file a motion for reconsideration. Motions for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of receipt of the Board's EAJA decision. Extensions in the period to file a motion will not be granted. Extensions to file a memorandum in support of a timely filed motion may be granted.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(p) Payment of Awards—The Board's EAJA awards will be paid directly by the contracting agency over which the applicant prevailed in the underlying CDA appeal.</p>

            <strong class="ph b">ADDENDUM II</strong>
         </p>
         <p class="p Ctr">
            <strong class="ph b">ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">1. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. 7105(g)(1), states that boards of contract appeals "shall ... to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes". Resolution of a dispute at the earliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least expensive method possible, benefits both parties. To that end, the parties are encouraged to consider Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures for pre-claim and pre-final decision matters, as well as appeals pending before the Board. The Board may also conduct ADRs for any Federal agency. However, if the matter is not pending before the Board under its CDA jurisdiction, any settlement may not be paid out of the Judgment Fund.</p>
         <p class="p List2">2. The ADR methods described in this Addendum are intended to suggest techniques that have worked in the past. Any appropriate method that brings the parties together in settlement, or partial settlement, of their disputes is a good method. The ADR methods listed are not intended to preclude the parties' use of other ADR techniques that do not require the Board's participation, such as settlement negotiations, fact-finding conferences or procedures, mediation, or minitrials not involving use of the Board's personnel. Any method, or combination of methods, including one that will result in a binding decision, may be selected by the parties without regard to the dollar amount in dispute.</p>
         <p class="p List2">3. The parties must jointly request ADR procedures at the Board. The request must be approved by the Board. The Board may also schedule a conference to explore the desirability and selection of an ADR method and related procedures. If an ADR involving the Board's participation is requested and approved by the Board, a Neutral will be appointed. If an Administrative Judge has already been assigned to an appeal, the same judge will normally be assigned to be the Neutral in an ADR. If an Administrative Judge has not yet been assigned to the appeal, or if the subject of the ADR is a matter pending before the contracting officer prior to any appeal, the Board will appoint an Administrative Judge to be the Neutral. In such instances, as well as situations in which the parties prefer that an assigned Administrative Judge not be appointed to serve as the Neutral, the parties may submit a list of at least three preferred Administrative Judges and the Board will endeavor to accommodate their preferences.</p>
         <p class="p List2">4. To facilitate full, frank and open discussion and presentations, any Neutral who has participated in a non-binding ADR procedure that has failed to resolve the underlying dispute will be recused from further participation in the matter unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing and the Board concurs. Further, the recused Neutral will not discuss the merits of the dispute or substantive matters involved in the ADR proceedings with other Board personnel.</p>
         <p class="p List2">5. Written material prepared specifically for use in an ADR proceeding, oral presentations made at an ADR proceeding, and all discussions in connection with such proceedings between the parties and the Neutral are confidential and, unless otherwise specifically agreed by the parties, inadmissible as evidence in any pending or future Board proceeding involving the parties or matter in dispute. However, evidence otherwise admissible before the Board is not rendered inadmissible because of its use in the ADR proceeding.</p>
         <p class="p List2">6. The ADR method and the procedures and requirements implementing the ADR method will be prescribed by the written agreement of the parties and approved by the Board. ADR methods can be used successfully at any stage of the litigation.</p>
         <p class="p List2">7. The following are examples of ADR methods commonly used at the Board:</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) Nonbinding—</p>
         <p class="p List1">Mediations: A Neutral is an Administrative Judge who will not normally hear or have any formal or informal decision-making authority in the matter and who is appointed for the purpose of facilitating settlement. In many circumstances, settlement can be fostered by a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position with the Neutral. The agenda for meetings with the Neutral will be flexible to accommodate the requirements of the case. To further the settlement effort, the Neutral may meet with the parties either jointly or individually. A Neutral’s recommendations are not binding on the parties. When this method is selected, the ADR agreement must contain a provision in which the parties and counsel agree not to subpoena the Neutral in any legal action or administrative proceeding of any kind to produce any notes or documents related to the ADR proceeding or to testify concerning any such notes or documents or concerning his/her thoughts or impressions.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Binding—</p>
         <p class="p List1">Summary Proceeding With Binding Decision: A summary proceeding with binding decision is a procedure whereby the resolution of the appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an Administrative Judge. A binding "bench" decision may be issued upon conclusion of the proceeding, or a binding summary written decision will be issued by the judge no later than ten days following the later of conclusion of the proceeding or receipt of a transcript. The parties must agree in the ADR agreement that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the Board under this method shall be final, conclusive, not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. All such decisions, rulings, and orders will have no precedential value. Prehearing, hearing, and post-hearing procedures and rules applicable to appeals generally will be modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Other Agreed Methods—</p>
         <p class="p List1">The parties and the Board may agree upon other informal methods, binding or nonbinding that are structured and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual case.</p>
         <p class="p List2">8. The above-listed ADR procedures are intended to shorten and simplify the Board's more formalized procedures. Generally, if the parties resolve their dispute by agreement, they benefit in terms of cost and time savings and maintenance or restoration of amicable relations. The Board will not view the parties' participation in ADR proceedings as a sign of weakness. Any method adopted for dispute resolution depends upon both parties having a firm, good faith commitment to resolve their differences. Absent such intention, the best structured dispute resolution procedure is unlikely to be successful.</p>

      <div class="body">
         <p class="p List2">1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sect. 601, et seq.), (b) pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their duly authorized representative, or (c) pursuant to the provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a Military Department or their authorized representative has granted a right of appeal not contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other departments and agencies by agreement as permitted by law. The Board shall operate under general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and may perform other duties as directed not inconsistent with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p>
         <p class="p List2">2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.

         <p class="p List2">3. It shall be the duty and obligation of the Judges of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation pertinent thereto.</p>
         <p class="p List2">4. The Chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman shall designate one Judge of each division as the division head. The Chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision process for decision by the senior deciding group. The division heads and the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, together with, if applicable, the author of the decision so referred, shall constitute the senior deciding group of the Board. The decision of the Board in cases so referred to the senior deciding group shall be by majority vote of the participating Judges of that group. A majority of the Judges of a division shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of the business of each, respectively. Decisions of the Board shall be by majority vote of the Judges of a division participating and the Chairman and a Vice-Chairman, unless the Chairman refers the appeal for decision by the senior deciding group. An appeal involving a small claim as defined by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 may be decided by a single Judge or fewer Judges of the Board than hereinbefore provided for cases of unlimited dollar amount, under accelerated or expedited procedures as provided in the Rules of the Board and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p>
         <p class="p List2">5. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the proper performance of its duties. The Board has the authority to issue methods of procedure and rules and regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of appeals and issuance of opinions.</p>
         <p class="p List2">6. Any Judge of the Board or any examiner, designated by the Chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and receive evidence and argument A Judge of the Board shall have authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. In cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chairman may request orders of the court in the manner prescribed in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p>
         <p class="p List2">7. The Chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization of the Board and for its administration. He shall provide within approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-Judge personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the performance of the functions of the Board. The Chairman shall appoint a Recorder of the Board. All personnel shall be responsible to and shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Chairman. Judges shall decide cases independently.</p>
         <p class="p List2">8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for administrative support as required for its operations. Administrative support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower control and utilization, personnel administration, security administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense will participate in financing the Board’s operations on an equal basis and to the extent determined by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be reimbursed.</p>
         <p class="p List2">9. Within 30 days following the close of a calendar quarter, the Chairman shall forward a report of the Board’s proceedings for the quarter to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition, and to the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency. The Chairman of the Board will also furnish the Secretary of Defense, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, the Secretaries of the Military Departments, and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency, an annual report containing an account of the Board’s transactions and proceedings for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
         <p class="p List2">10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: “Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.” This seal shall be affixed to all authentications of copies of records and to such other instruments as the Board may determine.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, preparation, anddistribution of the Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) Receiving Report (RR), WAWF Reparable Receiving Report (WAWF RRR), the WAWF Energy RR, and commercialshipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance. The WAWF RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR). The WAWF Energy RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for overland shipments and DD Form 250-1, Tanker/Barge Material Inspection and Receiving Report, for waterborne shipments. The WAWF RRR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for repair, maintenance, or overhaul of Government-furnished property.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The use of the DD Form 250 series documents is on an exception basis (see DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS-Subchapter_e.html#DFARS-232.7002">232.7002</a>(a)) because use of the WAWF RR is now required by most DoD contracts. WAWF provides for electronic preparation and documentation of acceptance of supplies and services, and electronic invoicing. In addition WAWF allows the printing of a RR that can be used as a packing list or when a signed copy is required.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) WAWF RR and DD Form 250.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, that indicate no DD Form 250 is required.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, contractors may prepare one WAWF RR or DD Form 250 to cover all such shipments.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for the contents of each vehicle.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the shipment includes items of more than one Federal supply class (FSC) or material management code (MMC), prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for items of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant Government representative may authorize a single WAWF RR or DD Form 250, listing each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock number applicable to the item.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD Form 250.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contiguous United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line item, on one WAWF RR or DD Form 250. To permit verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document (commercial or Government) with each individual load showing as a minimum—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The shipper;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Shipping point;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Consignee;</p>

         <p class="p List4">(K) Signature of supplier's representative.</p>
         <p class="p List4">When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) before signing Block 21b.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for contiguous United States applies, except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable to the receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than one contract line item in each WAWF RR or DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and acceptance data are the same for all line items.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD 250. Contractors may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, on one WAWF RR or DD 250. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report.

         <p class="p List3">(v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the truckload.</p>
         <p class="p List4">Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify each railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) WAWF RRR or DD Form 250. Use as in paragraph (a) of this section for delivery of services for repair, overhaul, or maintenance.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge cargo loaded.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same destination.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product loaded.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each grade of product discharged.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">F-301</span>Preparation instructions.</h5>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) General.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Preparation instructions and training for the WAWF RR are available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil. The instructions on preparing a WAWF RR are part of the Vendor Training section.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Prime contractors can direct subcontractors to prepare and submit documents in WAWF by giving their subcontractors access to WAWF via the creation of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) extension to the prime CAGE.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the contract is in Electronic Data Access (EDA) (DoD’s contract repository), then the WAWF system will automatically populate all available and applicable contract data.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) When source acceptance is required, WAWF will populate the “Inspect By” with the “Admin by” Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC). The vendor shall change the DoDAAC if Government Source Inspection (GSI) is performed at other than the “Admin By.”</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) WAWF will also verify that CAGE codes are valid and active in the System for Award Management (SAM), and that DoDAACs and Military Assistance Program Address Codes (MAPACs) are valid in Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) WAWF will populate the address information for CAGE codes, DODAACs, and MAPACs from SAM and DAAS. These sites are the DoD definitive sources for address information. Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed or additional information added.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Do not include classified information in WAWF.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Completion instructions.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) CONTRACT NO/DELIVERY ORDER NO.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) For stand-alone contracts, enter the 13-position alpha-numeric basic Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID) of the contract. For task and delivery orders numbered in accordance with FAR 4.1603 and DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS-Subchapter_a.html#DFARS-204.1603">204.1603</a>, enter the 13-character order number. The contract or agreement number under which the order was placed may be omitted from the WAWF RR. Alternatively, the contractor may choose to enter the contract number on the WAWF RR in addition to the 13-character order number. If the order has only a four-position alpha-numeric call or order serial number, enter both the 13-position basic contract PIID and the four-position order number.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(ii) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this appendix, do not entersupplementary numbers used in conjunction with basic PIIDs to identify—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Modifications of contracts and agreements;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Modifications to calls or orders; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Document numbers representing contracts written between contractors.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When shipping instructions are furnished and shipment is made before receipt of the confirming contract modification (SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract), enter a comment in the Misc. Info Tab to this effect. This will appear in the Comments section of the printed WAWF RR.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) SHIPMENT NO.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The shipment number format requires first three data positions to be alpha, fourth position alpha-numeric and last three positions numeric, e.g., DFAR001 or DAR0001. Any document used as a packing list must include the shipment number information.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The prime contractor shall control and assign the shipment number prefix. The shipment number shall consist of three alphabetic characters for each “Shipped From” address. The shipment number prefix shall be different for each “Shipped From” address and shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract. The prime contractor may assign separate prefixes when shipments are made from different locations within a facility identified by one “Shipped From” address.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Number the first shipment 0001 for shipments made under the contract or contract and order number from each “Shipped From” address, or shipping location within the “Shipped From” address. Consecutively number all subsequent shipments with the identical shipment number prefix. While shipments should be created sequentially they can be released and accepted out of sequence.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1) Use alpha-numeric serial numbers when more than 9,999 numbers are required. Serially assign alpha-numeric numbers with the alpha in the first position (the letters I and O shall not be used) followed by the three-position numeric serial number. Use the following alpha-numeric sequence:</p>
         <table class="table frame-none"><caption></caption><colgroup><col style="width:100%"></colgroup><tbody class="tbody">

                     </td>
                  </tr>
               </tbody></table>
         <p class="p List6">(2) When this series is completely used, the shipment number prefix will have to be changed when the series is completely used. WAWF will not allow duplicate shipment numbers to be created against a contract or contract and delivery order.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(ii) Reassign the shipment number of the initial shipment where a “Replacement Shipment” is involved (see paragraph (b)(16)(iv)(F) of this appendix).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The prime contractor shall control deliveries and on the final shipment of the contract shall end the shipment number with a “Z.” Where the final shipment is from other than the prime contractor's plant, the prime contractor may elect either to—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Direct the subcontractor making the final shipment to end that shipment number with a “Z”; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Upon determination that all subcontractors have completed their shipments, to correct the DD Form 250 (see F-304) covering the final shipment made from the prime contractor's plant by addition of a “Z” to that shipment number.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3) DATE SHIPPED. Enter the date the shipment is released to the carrier or the date the services are completed. If the shipment will be released after the date of contract quality assurance and/or acceptance, enter the estimated date of release. When the date is estimated, enter an “E” or select an "E" from the drop down menu in the “Estimated” block after the date. Do not delay submission of the WAWF RR for lack of entry of the actual shipping date. Correction of the WAWF RR is not required to show the actual shipping date (see F-303). Once the document is submitted the shipment date cannot be changed.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) B/L TCN. When applicable, enter—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The commercial or Government bill of lading number after “B/L;” WAWF provides the capability to separately and correctly identify the Government Bill of Lading (GBL) from a Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL). An authorized user will select whether the entered bill of lading number is either a GBL number or a CBL number.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The transportation control number must be a 17 alpha/numeric digit min/max field, and WAWF provides the capability to enter two secondary transportation tracking numbers.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(16) QUANTITY SHIPPED/RECEIVED.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Enter the quantity shipped, using the unit of measure in the contract for payment. When a second unit of measure is used for purposes other than payment, enter the appropriate quantity in the description field.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) On the final shipment of a line item of a contract containing a clause permitting a variation of quantity and an underrun condition exists, the prime contractor shall choose the Ship Advice Code “Z”. Where the final shipment is from other than the prime contractor's plant and an underrun condition exists, the prime contractor may elect to direct the subcontractor making the final shipment to choose the Ship Advice Code “Z”;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When the Government is performing destination acceptance the acceptor should enter actual quantity received in apparent good condition in the “Qty. Accepted” field of the Acceptor Line Item Tab.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(17) UNIT OF MEASURE. Enter the abbreviation of the unit measure as indicated in the contract for payment. Where a second unit of measure is indicated in the contract for purposes other than payment or used for shipping purposes, enter the second unit of measure in the description field. Authorized abbreviations are listed in MIL-STD-129, Marking for Shipping and Storage and in the WAWF Unit of Measure Table Link. For example, LB for pound, SH for sheet.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(18) UNIT PRICE. When using the WAWF RRR, the unit price is the price of the repair, overhaul, or maintenance service from the contract.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The contractor may, at its option, enter unit prices on the WAWF RR, except when the contract has IUID requirements and the receiving report is being processed in WAWF, the unit price must represent the acquisition cost that will be recorded in the IUID registry. Therefore, in such cases, the unit price is required. See DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS-Subchapter_h.html#DFARS-252.211-7003">252.211-7003</a>, Item Unique Identification and Valuation.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor shall enter unit prices for each item of property fabricated or acquired for the Government and delivered to a contractor as Government furnished property (GFP). Get the unit price from Section B of the contract. If the unit price is not available, use an estimate. The estimated price should be the contractor's estimate of what the items cost the Government. When the price is estimated, enter</p>
         <p class="p List3">“Estimated Unit Price” in the description field. When delivering GFP via WAWF to another contractor, WAWF will initiate a property transfer if the vendor who is initiating the WAWF RR is also registered as a vendor property shipper in WAWF and the vendor receiving the property is also a vendor property receiver in WAWF.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) For clothing and textile contracts containing a bailment clause, enter the cited Government furnished property unit value as “GFP UNIT VALUE” in the description field.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) For all copies of DD Forms 250 for FMS shipments, enter actual prices, if available. If actual prices are not available, use estimated prices. When the price is estimated, enter an “E” after the price.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(19) AMOUNT. WAWF will calculate and populate the amount by multiplying the unit price times the quantity.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(20) CONTRACT QUALITY ASSURANCE (CQA).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The words “conform to contract” contained in the text above the signature block in the WAWF RR Header Tab relate to quality and to the quantity of the items on the report. Enter notes taking exception in Misc. Info Tab comment field or on attached supporting documents with an appropriate block cross-reference.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When a shipment is authorized under an alternative release procedure, contractors will execute the alternative release procedure in WAWF by including the appropriate indicator in the electronic transaction rather than through inclusion or attachment of the text of the certificate. The alternative release procedure only provides for release of shipment; Government acceptance must still be indicated by a Government official’s signature on the WAWF RR.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When contract terms provide for use of Certificate of Conformance and shipment is made under these terms, contractors will execute Certificates in WAWF by including the appropriate indicator in the electronic transaction rather than through inclusion or attachment of the text of the certificate. Government acceptance must still be indicated by a Government official’s signature on the WAWF RR.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) ORIGIN.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The authorized Government representative must:—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1) Place an “X” in the appropriate CQA and/or acceptance box(es) to show origin CQA and/or acceptance; and</p>
         <p class="p List6">(2) Sign and date.</p>
         <p class="p List6">WAWF will enter the typed, stamped, or printed name, title, email address, and commercial telephone number.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) When fast pay procedures apply, the contractor or subcontractor shall select “FAST PAY” when creating the WAWF RR. When CQA is required, the authorized Government representative shall execute the block as required by paragraph (A).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) DESTINATION. When CQA and acceptance or acceptance is at destination, the authorized Government representative must—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Place an “X” in the appropriate box(es); and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Sign and date.</p>
         <p class="p List4">WAWF will enter the typed, stamped, or printed name, title, email address, and commercial telephone number.</p>

         <p class="p">There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor. The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the contractor’s presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-finding proceeding concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent that the proposed action stems from the contractor’s affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending official or designee to provide information as to the contractor’s present responsibility.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor’s behalf; individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the notice of suspension or proposed debarment.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of the debarment.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the contractor’s presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and suspending official.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the contractor’s presentation of matters in opposition. An official record will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The Government’s representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issue. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding proceeding.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) This Appendix I to 48 CFR Chapter 2 implements the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program (hereafter referred to as the “Program”) established under section 831 of Public Law 101-510, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2302 note), as amended through November 25, 2015. The purpose of the Program is to provide incentives to major DoD contractors to furnish eligible small business concerns with assistance designed to—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Enhance the capabilities of eligible small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts and other contracts and subcontracts; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Increase the participation of such business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts, other Federal Government contracts, and commercial contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protege firms to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost reimbursement or credit against applicable subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the Program results in—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal agencies, and commercial contracts) from the date of their entry into the Program until 2 years after the conclusion of the agreement;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a protege firm (or former protege firm) by its mentor firm (or former mentor firm); and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) An increase in the employment level of protege firms from the date of entry into the Program until 2 years after the completion of the agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Reimbursement through a separate contract line item in a DoD contract or a separate contract with DoD; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Credit toward applicable subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the Program.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) Prospective mentors and their proteges may choose to execute letters of intent prior to negotiation of mentor-protege agreements.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The agreements should be structured after completion of a preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the protege firm and mutual agreement regarding the developmental assistance to be provided to address those needs and enhance the protege’s ability to perform successfully under contracts or subcontracts.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) A mentor firm may not require a protege firm to enter into a mentor-protege agreement as a condition for award of a contract by the mentor firm, including a subcontract under a DoD contract awarded to the mentor firm.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The mentor-protege agreement may provide for the mentor firm to furnish any or all of the following types of developmental assistance:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Assistance by mentor firm personnel in—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) General business management, including organizational management, financial management, and personnel management, marketing, and overall business planning;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Engineering and technical matters such as production inventory control and quality assurance; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the developmental program described in I-107(g).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Award of subcontracts to the protege firm under DoD contracts or other contracts on a noncompetitive basis.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Payment of progress payments for the performance of subcontracts by a protege firm in amounts as provided for in the subcontract; but in no event may any such progress payment exceed 100 percent of the costs incurred by the protege firm for the performance of the subcontract. Provision of progress payments by a mentor firm to a protege firm at a rate other than the customary rate for the firm must be implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Advance payments under such subcontracts. The mentor firm must administer advance payments in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.4.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Loans.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Assistance that the mentor firm obtains for the protege firm from one or more of the following:</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) Small Business Development Centers established pursuant to section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Entities providing procurement technical assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Chapter 142 (Procurement Technical Assistance Centers).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Historically Black colleges and universities.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(v) Women’s business centers described in section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking either reimbursement or credit are strongly encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the developmental assistance pursuant to the mentor-protege agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and to address the need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protege agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protege agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontracts. Costs associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under the Program.</p>
