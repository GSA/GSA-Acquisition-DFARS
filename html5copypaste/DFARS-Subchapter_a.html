         <p class="p List3">(ii)  To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental.  Supplemental numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly with its FAR counterpart.</p>

Three paragraphs implementing <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 19.501</span>(a) would be numbered 219.501(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) rather than (a)(1), (2), and (3).  Further subdivision of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 219.501(1)(i)(A<em class="ph i">)(1)(i).</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up.  Parts, subparts, sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 70 and up.  Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number of (S-70) and up.  When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered using the <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 1.105-2</span>(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without skipping a unit.  For example, DFARS text supplementing <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 19.501</span> would be numbered 219.501-70.  Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70(a), (b), and (c).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the numbering sequence.  It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then italicized lower case Roman numerals.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item(s) being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.  For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold.  Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly related to the specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.  For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility.  Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (e.g., a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company).  Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.</p>
         <p class="p">“Offset costs” means the costs to the contractor of providing any direct or indirect offsets required (explicitly or implicitly) as a condition of a foreign military sale.</p>
         <p class="p">“Original component manufacturer” means an organization that designs and/or engineers a part and is entitled to any intellectual property rights to that part.</p>

Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury.

In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs.  The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409 may obtain judicial review of the order’s conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred.  No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee.  Review shall conform to Chapter 7 of Title 5, Unites States Code.  Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  When there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in accordance with <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-204.7104">204.7104</a>
            </span>;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement contract;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and quantity of the elements are not known until performance.  The contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  When the contract line item is established to refer to an exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block and enclosed in parentheses); or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi)  When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00,  100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  <em class="ph i">Separately identifiable.</em>  A contract line item must be identified separately from any other items or services on the contract.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—</p>

         <p class="p List4">(B)  Description of services.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3)  <em class="ph i">Separate delivery schedule</em>.  Each contract line item or service shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date expressly stated (“as required” constitutes an expressly stated delivery term).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line item.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  If a contract line item has more than one destination or delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the delivery schedule.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  <em class="ph i">Single accounting classification citation</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Each contract line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a contract line item is authorized in the following situations:</p>

However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule.  If the offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the separate line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p">Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or simplifying administration.  There are only two kinds of subline items:  those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more than one item that requires separate identification.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Informational subline items.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit).  These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced separately for payment purposes.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements.  However, these elements shall be included within the item description in the supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual significance.  Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price columns.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Informational subline items shall be used to identify each accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-204.7103-1">204.7103-1</a>

         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i"> Separately identified subline items</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Subline items will be used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, contract funds accounting, or other management purposes.  Such subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item number—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification.  A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the single accounting classification citation.  Establish a line item rather than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned additional accounting classification citations at a later date.  Identify the funding as described in <span class="ph DFARxref">

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its own NSN;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, or a combination of the three; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  Identify parts of an assembly or kit which—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Are separately priced.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its own—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price is included in another subline item or a different contract line item).  This requirement does not apply—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an attachment.  If management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-204.7103-1">204.7103-1</a>

         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's part number, scope of work, description of services).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Unit prices and extended amounts.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the subline items is identical.  If there is any variation, the subline item unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the subline items level.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be combined in a contract line item.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  When the price for items not separately priced is included in the price of another contract line or subline item, it may be necessary to withhold payment on the priced contract line or subline item until the included line or subline items that are not separately priced have been delivered.

         <p class="p List4">(A)  The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification applies to the total quantity of the original line item or subline.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification makes only minor changes in the specifications of some of the items ordered on the original line item or subline item and the resulting changes in unit price can be averaged to provide a new single unit price for the total quantity.  If the changes in the specifications make the item significantly distinguishable from the original item or the resulting changes in unit price cannot be averaged, create a new line item.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and the change does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number shall remain with the unchanged quantity.  Assign the changed quantity the next available number.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  <em class="ph i">Undefinitized items</em>.  In addition to the rules in paragraph (b)(2)(i), the following additional rules apply to undefinitized items—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  If the modification is undefinitized and increases the quantity of an existing definitized item, assign the undefinitized quantity the next available number.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  If the modification increases the quantity of an existing undefinitized item, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item may be used if the unit price for the new quantity is expected to be the same as the price for the original quantity.

         <p class="p List4">(C)  If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and definitizes the price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the original item number.  If there is any undefinitized portion of the item, assign it the next available number.  However, if the modification definitizes the price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the whole to arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added into the quantity of the existing item. </p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item, but does not change the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall retain the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number.  Assign the changed portion the next available number.</p>
