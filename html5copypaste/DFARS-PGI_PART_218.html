      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Use of electronic business (e-business) acquisition tools greatly enhances the efficacy of the contracting process in a contingency business environment (CBE). The CBE involves specific tools, policies, roles and responsibilities, and processes necessary to streamline delivery of goods and services to the end user and to implement an e-business program with the capabilities necessary to support an end-to-end electronic acquisition process in order to quickly obtain goods and services for the warfighter in an operational area. For information and procedures to effectively utilize CBE e-business tools, and additional policy references supporting use of the e-business tools, see the DoD CBE Guidebook at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/docs/CBE_Guidebook.docx.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Use of the following CBE e-business tools is mandatory when supporting a contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operation as defined in <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 2.101</span>:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The 3in1 Tool. The 3in1 Tool automates the field order, receipt, and purchase processes previously executed manually using the paper Standard Form (SF) 44. The 3in1 handheld device records and transmits cash and carry type purchases and payment data to the prime database for remote reconciliation and review, when conducting on-the-spot, over-the-counter field purchases where use of the Government Purchase Card is appropriate, but not feasible. The 3in1 database may be accessed on the Joint Contingency Contracting Systems (JCCS) website at https://www.jccs.gov/olvr/.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSA) Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS). AGATRS is an automated tool that tracks and provides visibility into worldwide ACSAs that may satisfy a requirement through support from the host nation or other nations supporting the contingency. ACSA transactions that are used in support of contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operations are required to be documented and tracked in AGATRS as required by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 2120.01C, Acquisition Cross Servicing Agreements (http://dtic.mil/cjcs_directives/cdata/unlimit/2120_01.pdf). AGATRS is accessible on the JCCS website at https://www.jccs.gov/olvr.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) No other electronic tools may be used to fulfill the same capabilities as 3in1 and AGATRS.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) See PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
