In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 637 note, DoD has established a test program to determine whether comprehensive subcontracting plans on a corporate,division, or plant-wide basis will reduce administrative burdens while enhancing subcontracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns.</p>
         <p class="p">This program is referred to as the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans (Test Program).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  <em class="ph i">Eligibility requirements.  </em>To become and remain eligible to participate in the Test Program, a business concern is required to have furnished supplies or services (including construction) under at least three DoD contracts during the preceding fiscal year, having an aggregate value of at least $100 million.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  If the contractor has failed to meet its approved subcontracting goal(s), the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, permitting the contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period at the contracting officer’s discretion) within which to respond.  The contracting officer may take the contractor’s failure to respond to the notice as an admission that no valid explanation exists.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The contracting officer shall review all available information to determine whether the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  If, after consideration of all relevant information, the contracting officer determines that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision.  The contracting officer’s final decision shall include the right of the contractor to appeal under the Disputes clause.  The contracting officer shall distribute a copy of the final decision to all cognizant contracting officers for the contracts covered under the plan.</p>

            <em class="ph i">coverage under the contract.</em>  Contract construction, alteration, renovation, painting, and repair requirements (i.e., roof shingling, building structural repair, paving repairs, etc.) are subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute.  Apply Construction Wage Rate Requirements clauses and minimum wage requirements to all contract service calls or orders for construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repairs to buildings or other works.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  <em class="ph i">Repairs versus maintenance.</em>  Some contract work may be characterized as either Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs or Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance.  For example, replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a wall could be covered by either the Construction Wage Rate Requirements or the Service Contract Labor Standards.  In those instances where a contract service call or order requires construction trade skills (i.e., carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear whether the work required is Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance or Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs, apply the following rules:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of 32 or more work-hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Individual service calls or orders which will require less than 32 work-hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute regardless of the total work-hours required.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  The determination of labor standards application shall be made at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where requirements can be identified.  Otherwise, the determination shall be made at the time the service call or order is placed against the contract.  The service call or order shall identify the labor standards law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work required.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f)  Contracting officers may not avoid application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by splitting individual tasks between orders or contracts.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Shall specify the time period over which the national security waiver applies; and</p>

If the USD(A&amp;S) determines that the noncompliance was knowing and willful, the appropriate debarring and suspending official shall consider suspending or debarring the contractor or subcontractor until such time as the contractor or subcontractor has effectively addressed the issues that led to the noncompliance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Because national security waivers will only be granted when the acquisition in question is necessary to the national security interests of the United States, the requirement for a plan will be applied as a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent, to the granting of a waiver.</p>

other than the application of the waiver.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List1">(b) The head

basis upon execution of a determination and findings that any of
the following applies:</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(1) The restriction
would cause unreasonable delays.</p>

quality items manufactured in the United States, Australia, or Canada,
or the United Kingdom are not available.</p>

of the restriction would result in the existence of only one source
for the item in the United States, Australia, or Canada, or the
United Kingdom.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(4) Application
of the restriction is not in the national security interests of
the United States.</p>

of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. company.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List1">(c) A restriction
is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs. The cost of an
item of U.S., Australian, Canadian, or United Kingdom origin is
unreasonable if it exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive
of duty, of items that are not of U.S., Australian, Canadian, or

Contracting officers may use a rating method in which a higher percentage of the offeror’s total workforce consisting of severely disabled individuals would result in a higher rating for this evaluation factor.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)(1)  Contracts awarded to eligible contractors under this Demonstration Project shall be counted toward DoD’s small disadvantaged business goal.
