         <p class="p" id="unique_1180811289__i1347730">The annual cost monitoring plan is a strategy for monitoring, reviewing, negotiating, and approving contractor’s direct and indirect rates, business systems, corrective actions to deficient processes, and cost controls by coordinating the capabilities of the CAO, DCAA, and other Government representatives in an effort to reduce unreasonable, erroneous, or improper costs to Government contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  <em class="ph i">Contents of the plan</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The plan should—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Provide coverage for each significant activity of the contractor over a period of five to ten years;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Provide coverage for contractor future years dependent on the period of forward pricing years the contractor proposes and the expected length of executed Government programs;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Be updated to reflect changed conditions as the year progresses; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Be consistent with the approved schedule, and any deviations should be explained in the final cost monitoring report.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The plan must identify the organizations having the primary responsibility for performing the reviews.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The plan should include reviews required by the ACO and DFARS. Reviews will be performed by the assigned organization during the coordination phase of the cost monitoring plan, except when DFARS makes a specific organizational assignment.  For example, Subpart 244.301 makes the ACO responsible for leading contractor purchasing system reviews and <span class="ph PGIxref">

         <p class="p List2">(3)  <em class="ph i">Selecting the activities</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The CAO selects the activities for the cost monitoring plan.  DCAA will complete its annual audit plan independently and communicate the approved audit plan to ensure the most effective monitoring approach.  To ensure all Government interests are considered in the selection, the CMS should invite CAO, DCAA, and other interested Government representatives to a meeting before the beginning of each Government fiscal year to identify and prioritize the areas to be reviewed during the coming year, to ensure a fully communicated Government cost monitoring plan.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The selection team should consider the following data and assign primary responsibility in the selection process—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Contractor forecasts for the coming years supporting direct and indirect costs by functional centers of its cost control system and the results of the latest survey performed of such systems;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Organizational charts for the contractor's entire operation;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Outline of the contractor's accounting system showing the flow of costs by function;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Determination of Government participation in the dollars attributable to the operations and cost accounts under consideration;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E)  List of recent reviews and audits performed by CAO, DCAA, and other Government representatives; list should show outstanding weakness and deficiencies in the contractor's operations that will be considered for follow-up reviews or audits;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F)  Evidence of contractor under or over staffing;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G)  Significant departures from established contractor productivity standards;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i)  The CMS should prioritize the plan to review contractor activity by considering—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  The extent of competition in awarded contracts;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  The contractor's operating methods;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  The nature of the work;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Acquisition cycle stage;</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  A basic principle of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System is that, upon contract award, contractors bring all the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, property, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them (reference <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 9.104-1</span> (e), (f), and (g) of General Standards).  Therefore, upon contract award, responsible contractors should have the means to provide effective and efficient stewardship of Government property.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Government property, as defined at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.101</span>, must be contractually accountable to a single contract and only one contract at a time. This requirement applies to both Government-furnished property and contractor-acquired property.  Although accountable to only one contract at a time, contract terms and conditions may allow Government property to be used on other contracts (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 52.245-9</span>, Use and Charges).</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The requiring activity (project or program manager, or purchase request generator), as part of its responsibility for acquisition planning (FAR part 7, Acquisition Planning), is the decision point as to whether or not to furnish property to contractors.  The basis for any decision to provide Government property shall be documented by the requiring activity and provided to the contracting officer.  Such documentation is not required when contractors are furnished property for repair, modification, or overhaul under a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Prior to furnishing Government property to the contractor, the contracting officer shall ensure that each of the requirements of <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.102</span> are addressed as follows, and documented in the contracting file—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Element 1: In the Government’s best interest.</em> Discussion should be specific, factual, and where necessary, address actual or projected dollars and percentages.  Merely selecting one or two objectives supported by a general, perfunctory discussion does not address this element satisfactorily.  Discussion should address the following factors:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Economy – Furnishing Government property is the lowest cost or price alternative.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Standardization – There is a critical need for precise replication.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Security – Government property is needed due to national security issues/concerns.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Expedite production – Government property is crucial to achieving timely or accelerated delivery of a supply item or service.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Scarcity – The Government can obtain scarce items, or is the only source of property necessary for successful execution of a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Maintain the industrial base – Government property is needed to ensure future capability to obtain a particular supply item or service.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Contract type – Government property will enable the Government to obtain a more favorable contract type.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Element 2</em>:  <em class="ph i">Overall benefit.</em>Demonstrate that the overall benefit to the acquisition significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including property disposal.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Property in the hands of contractors drives program costs.  Therefore, in order to make the case that providing Government property to the contractor is worthwhile, the associated costs must be considered and the business decision justified.  The costs of Government property removal and disposal, including demilitarization and disposal of environmentally-regulated property, must be included.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Costs must be either less than what the contractor might otherwise incur, or the demonstrated benefit to the Government must outweigh these additional contract costs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  <em class="ph i">Element 3:  Government assumption of risk.</em>  Demonstrate that providing the property does not substantially increase the Government’s risk.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Risk must be discussed and documented.  A risk analysis is warranted to demonstrate that the Government is not substantially increasing its risk.  For example, when furnishing Government property, the Government is ordinarily responsible for suitability of use, timely delivery, and replacement of defective Government property.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Other risks may need to be considered, discussed, and documented.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  <em class="ph i">Element 4:  Government requirements cannot otherwise be met</em>.  Document why the furnishing of Government property is critical and significant to meeting acquisition plan objectives.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(11)  The disposal of contractor inventory is the responsibility of the contractor.  However, the disposal/sales services of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services or a Federal agency, e.g., GSA, may be used in unusual or compelling circumstances, as determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Government, and provided DLA Disposition Services/the agency agrees.  In such cases, disposal/sales services may be provided on a reimbursable basis, with any sale proceeds credited in compliance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.604-4</span>, Proceeds from sales of surplus property.  If sale services are needed, the plant clearance officer will document the reasons in the case file and make arrangements directly with DLA Disposition Services, GSA, other Federal agency, or third-party.  The arrangements will include a requirement to return all proceeds to the plant clearance officer for crediting in compliance with<span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.604-4</span>.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Consult with the DoD Demilitarization (Demil)/Trade Security Control (TSC) Program office to determine if the contractor inventory can be sold to the public; and if a TSC assessment of the prospective buyer is required.  Reference DoD Instruction 2030.08, Implementation of Trade Security Controls (TSC) for Transfers of DoD U.S. Munitions List (USML) and Commerce Control List (CCL) Personal Property to Parties Outside DoD Control; and Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.28-M;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  If TSC is required, provide the DoD Demil/TSC Program office with a completed DLA Form 1822 End-Use Certificate (EUC) for the prospective buyer.  Note: TSC assessments/EUCs are typically not required for scrap sales; and </p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  Upon TSC clearance (if required) of the prospective buyer, authorize the contractor to complete the sale, as applicable. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(13)  To the extent that demilitarization, mutilation, or destruction is required, the PLCO may authorize the contractor to perform such action as follows: </p>

         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  Prior to granting an exception, the contracting officer shall request advice, oral or written, from the Commander, MSC, through the Contracts and Business Management Directorate, MSC (msc.n101.ffw@navy.mil), for voyage and time charters; or the USTRANSCOM Director of Acquisition, through the Sealift Services Division (transcom.scott.tcaq.mbx.i-foreign-flag-waiver@mail.mil), for ocean liner and intermodal transportation.</p>

         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>)  Take into consideration that the 1904 Act is, in part, a subsidy of the U.S.-flag commercial shipping industry that recognizes that lower prices may be available from foreign-flag carriers.  Therefore, a lower price for use of a foreign-flag vessel is not a sufficient basis, on its own, to determine that the freight rate proposed by the U.S.-flag carrier is excessive or otherwise unreasonable.

responsible for preparing, submitting, and receiving all records
required by DFARS Subpart 250.1. Records shall be maintained by
the contract adjustment boards of the Army, Navy, and Air Force,
respectively, and by the headquarters of the defense agencies.</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (2) A suggested format for the record
is the Record of Request for Adjustment shown at the end of this
section. This format permits the information required for the preliminary
and final records to be combined on one form. The following instructions
are provided for those items in the format that are not self-explanatory:</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (i) <em class="ph i">Extent of performance as of date
of request.</em> State the degree of completion of the contract;
e.g., 50 percent completed or performance not yet begun. If work
is completed, state the date of completion and whether final payment
has been made.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (ii) <em class="ph i">Award procedure. <span class="ph"></span>
            </em>State
whether the contract was awarded under sealed bidding or negotiated
procedures. Cite the specific authority for using other than full
and open competition, if applicable, e.g., 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (iii) <em class="ph i">Type of contract. <span class="ph"></span>
            </em>State
the type of contract (see FAR Part 16); e.g., FFP (firm-fixed-price).</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (iv) <em class="ph i">Category of case. <span class="ph"></span>
            </em>State
whether the request involves a modification without consideration,
a mistake, or an informal commitment. If the case involves more
than one category, identify both; list the most significant category
first.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (v) <em class="ph i">Amount or description of request. <span class="ph"></span>
            </em>If
the request is expressed in dollars, state the amount and whether
it is an increase or decrease. If the request cannot be expressed
in monetary terms, provide a brief description; e.g., "Cancellation"
or "Modification." Even if the adjustment is not easily expressed
in terms of dollars, if the contractor has made an estimate in the
request, that estimate should be stated.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (vi) <em class="ph i">Action below Secretarial level. <span class="ph"></span>
            </em>State
the disposition of the case, the office that took the action and
the date the action was taken. The disposition should be stated
as "Withdrawn," "Denied," "Approved," or "Forwarded." If the request
was approved, in whole or in part, state the dollar amount or nature
of the action (as explained in paragraph (2)(v) of this section).
The date should correspond with the date of the memorandum of decision
or of the letter forwarding the request to the contract adjustment
board or other deciding body.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (vii) <em class="ph i">Action by contract adjustment
board and date. <span class="ph"></span>
