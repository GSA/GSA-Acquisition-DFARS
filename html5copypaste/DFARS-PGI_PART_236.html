         <p class="p List2">(4) Use performance evaluation data from the Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The primary factor in architect-engineer contractor selection is the determination of the most highly qualified firm.

In considering equitable distribution of work among architect-engineer firms, include small business concerns; historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions; firms that have not had prior DoD contracts; and small disadvantaged business concerns and joint ventures with small disadvantaged business participants if the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector of the acquisition is one in which use of a price evaluation adjustment is currently authorized (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 19.201</span>(b)).</p>
