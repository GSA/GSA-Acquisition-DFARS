         <p class="p List3">(i)  In the absence of adequate price competition in response to the solicitation, pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price (see PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_DFARS-Subchapter_c.html#DFARS-PGI_PGI_215.404-1">215.404-1</a>
            </span>(b)(i)).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison.  The contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (section 853 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Pub. L. 114-92)).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data.  However, no cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions, quantities, and market and economic factors.  For similar items, the contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.404-1</span>(b)(2)(ii)(B) and PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_DFARS-Subchapter_c.html#DFARS-PGI_PGI_215.404-1">215.404-1</a>
            </span>(b)(v)).  Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting officer’s determination of price reasonableness.  The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating the relevance of the information available:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  <em class="ph i">Market prices</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  <em class="ph i">Age of data</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry (e.g., rapidly evolving technologies), product maturity (e.g., stable), economic factors (e.g., new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)  A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the anticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be expected to materially influence the contracting officer’s determination of price reasonableness.  The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as they may have information about pending sales.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  <em class="ph i">Volume and completeness of transaction data</em>.  Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to represent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers.

         <p class="p List2">(1)  <em class="ph i">Purpose</em>.  The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application.  It—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment).  The procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  <em class="ph i">Completion instructions</em>.  Complete a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost.  Complete the form as follows:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF.  The structure and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three displays.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be incurred each year.  The sum of these products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the yearly amounts.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  <em class="ph i">Preaward facilities capital applications</em>.  To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed as follows:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  <em class="ph i">Cost of Money.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  <em class="ph i">Cost Objective</em>.  Use the imputed facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type contract.  Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of contract performance.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  <em class="ph i">Profit Objective</em>.  When measuring the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs.  Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(b)  To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to evaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The contractor’s participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4)  The contractor’s cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information technology).  Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor’s cost reduction initiatives over time;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  The contractor’s adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;</p>

Cost of money under CAS 417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective.  The profit amount in the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  This adjustment is needed for the following reason:  The values of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from an element of profit to an element of contract cost (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 31.205-10</span>) and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance risk.  In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar adjustments shall be made to contracts that use alternate structured approaches.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a)  The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the following types of services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)).  Covered services are—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills (e.g., training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  Environmental remediation services for—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  An active military installation;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 2306c(b)).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment.  As used in this section, "useful commercial life" means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of theunamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 2306c(c)).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that¾</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Furnishing the services will require¾</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the value of the multiyear contract exceeds $678.5 million unless a law specifically provides authority for the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(2)).</p>

         <p class="p List1">(h)  The head of the agency shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfiedbefore awarding a multiyear contract for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, are included in the agency’s budget estimate submission and the President’s budget request.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress in writing, by no later than30 days before entry into such contracts, that each of the conditions in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section is satisfied (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in<span class="ph FARxref">FAR 17.105-1</span>, paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5), will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(A)).</p>

         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 USC 2433(d) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(C)).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C.2306b(i)(3)(D)).</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)  It includes task orders and delivery orders.</p>
