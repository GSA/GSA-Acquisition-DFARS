         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  When two or more military installations or activities have personal property responsibilities in a given area, one activity must contract for the estimated requirements of all activities in the area. The installation commanders concerned must designate the activity by mutual agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Commander, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), must designate the contracting activity when local commanders are unable to reach agreement.</p>

         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  When requiring activities need additional services that exceed contractor capabilities available under contracts, contracting officers should use simplified acquisition procedures to satisfy those excess requirements. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Additional services are those not specified in the bid items.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Additional services may include—</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Contracting officers should consider contracting for local moves that do not require drayage by using hourly rate or constructive weight methods. The rate will include those services necessary for completion of the movement, including—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Packing and unpacking;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(iv)  The contracting officer may obtain additional services by—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Including them as items within the contract, provided they are not used in the evaluation of bids (see DFARS 252.247-7008, Evaluation of Bids); or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  Either predetermine prices for additional services with the contractor, or negotiate them on a case-by-case basis.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi)  The contracting officer must authorize the contractor to perform any additional services, other than attempted pick up or delivery, regardless of the contracting method.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii)  To the maximum extent possible, identify additional services required that are incidental to an order before placing the order, or, when applicable, during the pre-move survey.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  Contract distribution.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Contiguous United States personal property shipping activities must send the copy to the Commander, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), ATTN:  AMSSD-PP, 709 Ward Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  In the European and Pacific areas, personal property shipping activities must send the copy to either the Property Directorate, SDDC Europe, or the Field Office-Pacific.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(d)  When preparing solicitations for personal property for shipment or storage, and intra-area or intra-city movement, contracting officers should follow the procedures in DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 404 at http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr-part-4-404.pdf, and Appendix G at http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr-part-4-app-g.pdf.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i)  Carrier demurrage/detention is a charge made against a consignor (shipper) or consignee (receiver) for the extended use of carrier-furnished equipment when delays attributable to the consignor or consignee occur.  Carrier demurrage/detention rules usually allow a period of free time for loading, unloading, or holding equipment.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Carrier-published demurrage/detention rules and charges are not uniform from one carrier to another.  Contracting officers should specifically address them in the contract.  While demurrage/detention rules are published in individual carrier tariffs or agency tenders, Contracting Officers may negotiate contract-specific demurrage/detention rules and charges independent of any existing tariffs or tenders.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  Process any modification of schedule format, other than those authorized in paragraph (c) of this subsection, as a request for deviation to the Commander, SDDC.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(b)  <em class="ph i">Procedures.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Contracting officers shall follow these procedures when ocean transportation is not the principal purpose of the contract, and the cargo to be transported is owned by DoD or is clearly identifiable for eventual use by DoD.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  DD Form 1653, Transportation Data for Solicitations, shall be used—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  By the requesting activity in developing the Government estimate for transportation costs; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  By the contracting officer in ensuring that valid shipping instructions and delivery terms are included in solicitations and contracts that may involve transportation of supplies by sea.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)(A)  If the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the contractor or a subcontractor considers that no U.S.-flag vessels are available, the contracting officer shall request confirmation of the nonavailability from—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  The Commander, Military Sealift Command (MSC), through the Contracts and Business Management Directorate, MSC (msc.n101.ffw@navy.mil), for voyage and time charters; or</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)  The Commander, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution (SDDC), through the SDDC global e-mailbox (usarmy.scott.sddc.mbx.ffw-team@mail.mil) for ocean liner and intermodal transportation.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  If the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the contractor or a subcontractor considers that the proposed freight charges to the Government, the contractor, or any subcontractor are higher than charges for transportation of like goods to private persons, the contracting officer may approve a request for an exception to the requirement to ship on U.S.-flag vessels for a particular shipment.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  Prior to granting an exception, the contracting officer shall request advice, oral or written, from the Commander, MSC, through the Contracts and Business Management Directorate, MSC (msc.n101.ffw@navy.mil), for voyage and time charters; or the USTRANSCOM Director of Acquisition, through the Sealift Services Division (transcom.scott.tcaq.mbx.i-foreign-flag-waiver@mail.mil), for ocean liner and intermodal transportation.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)  In advising the contracting officer whether to grant the exception, evidence from the following sources shall be considered, as appropriate—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>)  Published tariffs;</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>)  Industry publications;</p>

         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  The contracting officer shall prepare a report in determination and findings format, and shall—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>)  Take into consideration that the 1904 Act is, in part, a subsidy of the U.S.-flag commercial shipping industry that recognizes that lower prices may be available from foreign-flag carriers.  Therefore, a lower price for use of a foreign-flag vessel is not a sufficient basis, on its own, to determine that the freight rate proposed by the U.S.-flag carrier is excessive or otherwise unreasonable.  However, such a price differential may indicate a need for further review;</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>)  Consider, accordingly, not only excessive profits to the carrier (to include vessel owner or operator), if ascertainable, but also excessive costs to the Government (i.e., costs beyond the economic penalty normally incurred by excluding foreign competition) resulting from the use of U.S.-flag vessels in extraordinarily inefficient circumstances; and</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>)  Include an analysis of whether the cost is excessive, taking into account factors such as—</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">a</em>)  The differential between the freight charges proposed by the U.S.-flag carrier and an estimate of what foreign-flag carriers would charge based upon a price analysis;</p>
