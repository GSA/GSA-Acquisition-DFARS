      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) In accordance with Joint Publication 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, at http://www.apexnet.org/docs/Joint_Publication_1.pdf, the geographic combatant commander or subordinate joint force commander, through his command authority to exercise operational control, has the authority to exercise control over the assignment of contract administration during contingency operations, consistent with the combat support agency’s established mission functions, responsibilities, and core competencies, for contracts requiring delivery of items or performance within the area of operations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In certain contingency operations, the combatant commander or joint force commander may promulgate theater or joint operations area guidance for contracting that may include establishing—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A contracting command and control structure;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Head of contracting activity responsibilities, specific orders, and policies, including local clauses;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(iv) Procedures and requirements for contract clearance and contract administration of contracts requiring delivery of items and performance within the area of operations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When a combat support agency is tasked by the combatant commander to provide contingency contract administration services in support of contingency operations and such support will be required for a long duration, the combat support agency shall initiate a memorandum of agreement with the combatant commander or joint force commander. This agreement shall clearly delineate the purpose of the support, respective responsibilities of the combat support agency and the joint, lead service, or service contracting activity requesting the support, combat support agency support parameters, and a resolution process for resolving support issues.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The memorandum of agreement should focus on maximizing the combat support agency’s core competencies to address the more critical, complex, high-risk, and specialized oversight requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The memorandum of agreement should take into consideration the combat support agency’s core competencies, workload priorities, and contract administration services support parameters for accepting requests for contract administration services support.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A combat support agency shall not be assigned to perform tasks outside its mission functions, responsibilities, or core competencies.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Contracting officers contemplating requesting contract administration support in a contingency area from a combat support agency should first ascertain whether such a memorandum of agreement exists by contacting their combat support agency point of contact and/or checking the combatant commander operational contract support website (referenced in DFARS PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">

         <p class="p List4">(B) Reference: Key documents or reference(s) associated with the execution of the contract administration services support.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Clearing-house functions performed by the designated joint or lead component contracting activity in the operational area–</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1) Contract clearance parameters – when required;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(2) Contract delegation parameters – when required.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Contract administration services support parameters—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1) Acceptable for delegation - contract types that will be accepted by the combat support agency based on risk, dollar threshold, geographic dispersion of performance, service type, criticality of acceptance, or other criteria;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(2) Generally not be delegated – below-threshold contract types;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(3) Will not be delegated – no agency expertise to oversee.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Delegation process – process for accepting and assigning contract administration services tasks within the combat support agency.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Joint resolution process – procedures in the event of disagreement on actions to be supported by the combat support agency.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Term of the Agreement and Modification - length of time the agreement will be in effect and procedures for the parties to modify or terminate it.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Disputes regarding requested support should be resolved at the lowest management level possible, through a predetermined resolution process. When support issues arise that affect the ability of a combat support agency to provide contract administration support that cannot be resolved at lower management levels, follow procedures set forth in DoDI 3000.06, Combat Support Agencies, paragraphs 5.6.8 and 5.6.9, (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300006p.pdf).</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a)(1)(ii)(<em class="ph i">1</em>) The following are examples, not all-inclusive, of Product and Service Codes (PSCs) that contain items of clothing:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) Clothing apparel (such as outerwear, headwear, underwear, nightwear, footwear, hosiery, or handwear) listed in PSC 8405, 8410, 8415, 8420, 8425, 8450, or 8475.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) Footwear listed in PSC 8430 or 8435.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) Hosiery, handwear, or other items of clothing apparel, such as belts and suspenders, listed in PSC 8440 or 8445.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) Badges or insignia listed in PSC 8455.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The PSCs listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(<em class="ph i">1</em>) of this section also contain items that are not clothing, such as—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Visors;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Kevlar helmets;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Handbags; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Plastic identification tags.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Each item should be individually analyzed to determine if it is clothing, rather than relying on the PSC alone to make that determination.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The fact that an item is excluded from the foreign source restriction of the Berry Amendment applicable to clothing does not preclude application of another Berry Amendment restriction in DFARS 225.7002-1 to the components of the item.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Small arms protective inserts (SAPI plates) are an example of items added to, and not normally associated with, clothing. Therefore, SAPI plates are not covered under the Berry Amendment as clothing. However, fabrics used in the SAPI plate are still subject to the foreign source restrictions of the Berry Amendment. If the fabric used in the SAPI plate is a synthetic fabric or a coated synthetic fabric, the fibers and yarns used in the fabric are not covered by the Berry Amendment, because the fabric is a component of an end product that is not a textile product (see DFARS 225.7002-2(m).</p>
         <p class="p List2">
            <em class="ph i">Example</em>: A SAPI plate is compliant with the Berry Amendment if the synthetic fiber or yarn is obtained from foreign country X and woven into synthetic fabric in the United States, which is then incorporated into a SAPI plate manufactured in foreign country Y.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Hand or measuring tools.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) As applied to hand or measuring tools, “produced in the United States” means that the hand or measuring tool was assembled in the United States out of components, or otherwise made from raw materials into the finished product that is to be provided to the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) If a hand or measuring tool was assembled in a country other than the United States, then disassembled and reassembled in the United States, the hand or measuring tool was not produced in the United States.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The requirement to buy hand or measuring tools produced in the United States does not impose any restriction on the source of the components of the hand or measuring tools. This is unlike the Berry Amendment restriction on clothing (see <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-PGI_PGI_225.7002-1">225.7002-1</a>
            </span>(a)(1)(ii)), which explicitly requires domestic source for the materials and components of clothing (other than unusual components such as sensors or electronics), as well as the additional separate restrictions on various types of fibers and fabrics that might be components of the clothing.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) If the acquisition of the hand or measuring tools is also subject to the Buy American statute (see FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">25.1</span>), then in order to qualify as a domestic end product, the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States or a qualifying country, must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components of the hand or measuring tool.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a)(3) <em class="ph i">Offsets</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Offsets are the entire range of industrial and commercial benefits provided to foreign governments as an inducement or condition to purchase military supplies or services, including benefits such as coproduction, licensed production, subcontracting, technology transfer, in-county procurement, marketing and financial assistance, and joint ventures (Defense Offsets Disclosure Act of 1999, Pub. L. 106-113, section 1243(3)). There are two types of offsets: direct offsets and indirect offsets.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A direct offset involves benefits, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item being purchased. For example, as a condition of a U.S. sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the purchaser to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) An indirect offset involves benefits, including supplies or services that are unrelated to the item being purchased. For example, as a condition of a sale the contractor may agree to purchase certain of the customer's manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services. Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Offset costs are the costs to the contractor of providing any direct or indirect offsets required (explicitly or implicitly) as a condition of purchase in a government-to-government sale of defense articles and/or defense services as defined by the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer’s purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract. Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. (http://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-6).</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Supplies</em>. Unless the entire acquisition is exempt from the Balance of Payments Program, evaluate offers for supplies that are subject to the Balance of Payments Program using the evaluation procedures in DFARS Subpart <span class="ph DFARxref">225.5</span>. However, treatment of duty may differ when delivery is overseas.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Duty may not be applicable to nonqualifying country offers.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The U.S. Government cannot guarantee the exemption of duty for components or end products imported into foreign countries.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Foreign governments may impose duties. Evaluate offers including such duties as offered.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Construction</em>. Because the contracting officer evaluates the estimated cost of foreign and domestic construction material in accordance with DFARS 225.7501(a)(6)(iv) before issuing the solicitation, no special procedures are required for evaluation of construction offers.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(E) Contracting officers should not answer any questions a contractor may ask regarding the State Department requirement, mentioned in the clause at 252.225-7048, for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. If asked, the contracting officer should direct the contractor’s attention to paragraph (b) of the clause, which directs the contractor to consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR. (The registration requirements are in Subpart 122.1 of the ITAR. Subpart 122.1 requires any person who engages in the United States in the business of either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or furnishing defense services to register with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.)</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">The Export Administration Regulations (EAR)</em>, issued by the Department of Commerce, control the export of dual-use items, (items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications) and purely commercial items.

         <p class="p List3">(i) NSDD 189 establishes a national policy that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled items, as defined in paragraph (a) of the clause at DFARS 252.225-7048.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research, whether basic, fundamental, or applied, from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or the regulations that implement those statutes (the ITAR and the EAR). Thus, if export-controlled items are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">PGI 225.7902-2</span> Purpose.</h4>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) Background. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The U.S. Government controls exports of defense articles, technical data, and defense services. The controls are imposed by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the Department of State regulation that implements the AECA export controls. That regulation is the ITAR. See PGI 204.7302(2)(i) for more information about the ITAR.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Under the ITAR, the Department of State manages an export licensing system in which government approvals are often necessary for companies to hold discussions about potential projects, pursue joint activities, ship hardware, or transfer know-how to one another, and even sometimes to move engineers and other personnel within branches of the same company located in different countries. This process can be challenging for U.S. exporters and for foreign firms in their supply chains.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Given the close allied relationship of the United States with Australia and the United Kingdom, the President and the respective Prime Ministers decided to reform the defense trade system between their countries with the goal of facilitating the exchange of certain defense articles, technical data, and defense services between their militaries and security authorities, and their industries. They negotiated bilateral Defense Trade Cooperation DTC Treaties to achieve this goal. These bilateral DTC Treaties establish permissions for export without export licenses for each country, if an export meets the DTC Treaty requirements. </p>
         <p class="p">Other exports remain under the AECA and the ITAR. The DTC Treaties are intended solely to waive certain requirements of the ITAR for specific transactions within the scope of the DTC Treaties not remove any requirements for contractors to comply with domestic U.S. law.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The Department of State regulations implementing the DTC Treaties are in the ITAR. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) How the DTC Treaties work. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The DTC Treaties establish Approved Communities. The “Approved Community” for each DTC Treaty is defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7047. Exports of most U.S. defense articles, technical data, and defense services are permitted to go into and to move within the Approved Community, without the need for government approvals and export licenses (provided that all persons comply with statutory and regulatory requirements outside of DFARS and ITAR concerning the import of defense articles and defense services or the possession or transfer of defense articles, including, but not limited to, regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found at 27 C.F.R. Parts 447, 478, and 479, which are unaffected by the DTC Treaties) when in support of the following:</p>
         <p class="p">•	Combined U.S.-Australia or U.S.-U.K. military or counterterrorism operations. </p>
         <p class="p">•	U.S.-Australia or U.S.-U.K. cooperative security and defense research, development, production, and support programs.</p>
         <p class="p">•	Specific security and defense projects that are for the government of Australia or the government of the United Kingdom use only.</p>
         <p class="p">•	U.S. Government end use.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Under the DTC Treaties, instead of a U.S. exporter preparing and requesting Department of State approval of an export license or other written authorization for a project, the exporter may elect to use the applicable DTC Treaty if Treaty conditions are met. If using a DTC Treaty, the exporter will check the Department of State website (http://pmddtc.state.gov/) or other appropriate reference and verify that— </p>
         <p class="p">•	The Australian or U.K. partner is on the list of approved companies/facilities (i.e., a member of the Approved Community);</p>
         <p class="p">•	The effort is in support of at least one of the scope areas identified in paragraph (2)(i) of this section; and</p>
         <p class="p">•	The defense article is not on the exempted technology list. (Also in 22 CFR 126 Supplement No. 1).</p>
         <p class="p">If all three conditions are met, then the U.S. exporter and the Australian or U.K. partner may use the DTC Treaty exemptions in the ITAR to move qualifying defense articles without the need to obtain export licenses or other written authorizations, provided compliance with paragraph (2)(i) of this section. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A company using a DTC Treaty, in addition to checking the three lists (as explained in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section), must also comply with requirements in the applicable DTC Treaty and the associated Implementing Arrangements, and the provisions of the ITAR pertaining to the DTC Treaty. These include marking and recordkeeping requirements to ensure that export-controlled items are recognized as such and treated accordingly. For example, instead of normal ITAR requirements, the provisions of the ITAR pertaining to the DTC Treaties establish the requirements that apply. Similarly, DFARS 225.7902  implements requirements that relate to exports that a prospective contractor may make under a DoD solicitation or that a contractor may make in performance of a DoD contract. </p>
         <p class="p">The company must continue to comply with domestic laws and regulations, including those pertaining to the movement of defense articles within the United States.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">PGI 225.7902-4</span> Procedures.</h4>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) Since the DTC Treaties apply only to eligible items, a solicitation or contract falls within the scope of the DTC Treaties, and is thus eligible for DTC Treaty coverage (i.e., falls within the scope of the DTC Treaties) if it will acquire at least one defense article that is not otherwise exempt from the DTC Treaties and is required for—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Combined military or counterterrorism operations as described in the Implementing Arrangements;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Cooperative security and defense research, development, production, and support programs that are identified pursuant to the Implementing Arrangements;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Cases where the government or Australia or the government of the United Kingdom is the end user in mutually agreed specific security and defense projects, that are identified pursuant to the Implementing Arrangements; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) U.S. Government end use under a solicitation or contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Since the DTC Treaties apply only to eligible items, a solicitation or contract falls within the scope of the DTC Treaties and is thus eligible for DTC Treaty coverage when it will acquire at least one defense article that is DTC Treaty-eligible and the contract falls within the scope of the DTC Treaties. Article 3, section (2) of each DTC Treaty and Section 4 of each Implementing Arrangement require the DTC Treaty Participants to maintain lists of defense articles to be exempted from the scope of the DTC Treaties. These exempted technology lists are incorporated in Supplement No. 1 to part of the ITAR and are accessible at: http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/treaties/index.html </p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The DTC Treaties do not apply to defense articles initially being acquired pursuant to the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, although, once the defense articles are acquired by the Australia or United Kingdom under an FMS case, the DTC Treaty applies as though the defense articles were exported under the DTC Treaty, subject to PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-PGI_PGI_225.7902-2">225.7902-2</a>
            </span>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) If a company obtains an export license, or other authorization, for the export of defense articles that might otherwise have been eligible for export without a license under a DTC Treaty, the terms of the export license, or other authorization, shall apply unless and until the company obtains approval to transition to DTC Treaty coverage. The process and requirements for transition are described in 22 CFR 126.16(i) and 22 CFR 126.17(i), respectively.</p>
