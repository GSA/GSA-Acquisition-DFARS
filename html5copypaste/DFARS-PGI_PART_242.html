         <p class="p List2">(2)  Contract administration offices.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Contract administration offices (CAOs), which are designated as cost monitoring sites, are responsible for—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Assigning a cost monitoring specialist (CMS) to conduct the program.  The CMS may be the administrative contracting officer (ACO) or any other CAO employee whose normal function relates to evaluation of contractor performance.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(C)  Ensuring the contractor implements corrective action recommended in the cost monitoring review reports; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Resolving disputes with the contractor regarding cost monitoring review findings, conclusions, or recommendations.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The CMS is responsible for managing the cost monitoring effort within the CAO and coordinating planned effort with the contract auditor. This includes—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Preparing and maintaining an annual written cost monitoring plan for reviewing contractor operations (see paragraph (d));</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Maintaining an inventory of planned and completed CAO, Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and other Government reviews and audits in order to mitigate duplication of efforts;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Monitoring contractor direct and indirect rates and factors during the year, making comparisons to historical actual costs and to contractor proposed or negotiated forward pricing rates and factors, and providing rate recommendations based on their analysis;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Performing approved functional reviews of contractor activities, to include assisting Government personnel in obtaining access to pertinent contractor policies, procedures, and related data;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E)  Advising the ACO and CAO management of corrective action recommended to improve inefficient or uneconomical contractor conditions, policies, or practices, to include preparing, for the ACO's consideration when appropriate, a Notice of Intent to Disallow or Not Recognize Costs;</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3)  <em class="ph i">Audit and other organizations</em>.</p>

         <p class="p" id="unique_358016030__i1347730">The annual cost monitoring plan is a strategy for monitoring, reviewing, negotiating, and approving contractor’s direct and indirect rates, business systems, corrective actions to deficient processes, and cost controls by coordinating the capabilities of the CAO, DCAA, and other Government representatives in an effort to reduce unreasonable, erroneous, or improper costs to Government contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  <em class="ph i">Contents of the plan</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The plan should—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Provide coverage for each significant activity of the contractor over a period of five to ten years;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Provide coverage for contractor future years dependent on the period of forward pricing years the contractor proposes and the expected length of executed Government programs;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Be updated to reflect changed conditions as the year progresses; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Be consistent with the approved schedule, and any deviations should be explained in the final cost monitoring report.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The plan must identify the organizations having the primary responsibility for performing the reviews.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The plan should include reviews required by the ACO and DFARS. Reviews will be performed by the assigned organization during the coordination phase of the cost monitoring plan, except when DFARS makes a specific organizational assignment.  For example, Subpart 244.301 makes the ACO responsible for leading contractor purchasing system reviews and <span class="ph PGIxref">

         <p class="p List2">(3)  <em class="ph i">Selecting the activities</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The CAO selects the activities for the cost monitoring plan.  DCAA will complete its annual audit plan independently and communicate the approved audit plan to ensure the most effective monitoring approach.  To ensure all Government interests are considered in the selection, the CMS should invite CAO, DCAA, and other interested Government representatives to a meeting before the beginning of each Government fiscal year to identify and prioritize the areas to be reviewed during the coming year, to ensure a fully communicated Government cost monitoring plan.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The selection team should consider the following data and assign primary responsibility in the selection process—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Contractor forecasts for the coming years supporting direct and indirect costs by functional centers of its cost control system and the results of the latest survey performed of such systems;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Organizational charts for the contractor's entire operation;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Outline of the contractor's accounting system showing the flow of costs by function;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Determination of Government participation in the dollars attributable to the operations and cost accounts under consideration;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E)  List of recent reviews and audits performed by CAO, DCAA, and other Government representatives; list should show outstanding weakness and deficiencies in the contractor's operations that will be considered for follow-up reviews or audits;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F)  Evidence of contractor under or over staffing;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G)  Significant departures from established contractor productivity standards;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H)  Major financial variances from forecasts in prior years;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(I)  Evidences of idle or under-used capacity;</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="unique_358016030__i1347758">(J)  Any visits or audit plans scheduled by other Government organizations and identified to the CMS; and</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4)  <em class="ph i">Prioritizing the plan</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The CMS should prioritize the plan to review contractor activity by considering—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  The extent of competition in awarded contracts;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  The contractor's operating methods;</p>
