         <p class="p">For acquisitions covered by DFARS 207.103(d)(i)(A) and (B), correlate the plan to the DoD Future Years Defense Program, applicable budget submissions, and the decision coordinating paper/program memorandum, as appropriate. It is incumbent upon the planner to coordinate the plan with all those who have a responsibility for the development, management, or administration of the acquisition. The acquisition plan should be provided to the contract administration organization to facilitate resource allocation and planning for the evaluation, identification, and management of contractor performance risk.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(D) Milestones for updating the acquisition plan. Indicate when the plan will be updated. Program managers should schedule updates to coincide with DAB reviews and the transition from one phase to another (e.g., system development and demonstration to production and deployment).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) <em class="ph i">Supplies and services.</em> To determine if acquisitions for supplies or services are covered by DFARS 208.7, acquisition officials shall use the AbilityOne Program Procurement List published by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled at http://www.abilityone.gov/procurement_list/index.html (see FAR 8.7).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)(i) Life-cycle cost. When acquiring tents or other temporary structures, consider total life-cycle costs in accordance with DFARS 215.101.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Acquisition considerations</em>. When supplies or services will be acquired by placing an order under a non-DoD contract (e.g., a Federal Supply Schedule contract), regardless of whether the order is placed by DoD or by another agency on behalf of DoD, address the method of ensuring that the order will be consistent with DoD statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the acquisition and the requirements for use of DoD appropriated funds.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(B) <em class="ph i">Industrial Capability (IC)</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Provide the program’s IC strategy that assesses the capability of the U.S. industrial base to achieve identified surge and mobilization goals. If no IC strategy has been developed, provide supporting rationale for this position.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) If, in the IC strategy, the development of a detailed IC plan was determined to be applicable, include the plan by text or by reference. If the development of the IC plan was determined not to be applicable, summarize the details of the analysis forming the basis of this decision.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) If the program involves peacetime and wartime hardware configurations that are supported by logistics support plans, identify their impact on the IC plan.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) <em class="ph i">Special considerations for acquisition planning for crisis situations.</em> Ensure that the requirements of DoD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, are addressed. Also—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Acquisition planning must consider whether a contract is likely to be performed in crisis situations outside the United States and must develop appropriately detailed measures for inclusion in the contract. Combatant commanders establish operational plans identifying essential services that must continue during crisis. DoDI 1100.22 requires Combatant Commanders to develop contingency plans if they have a reasonable doubt that a contractor will continue to provide essential services during a mobilization or crisis. When planning the acquisition, consider these operational plans and the resources available to carry out these plans.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) During acquisition planning, identify which services have been declared so essential that they must continue during a crisis situation. A best practice is to create a separate section, paragraph, line, or other designation in the contract for these essential services so they can be tracked to an option or separate contract line item. </p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) The requirements for the contractor written plan for continuity of essential services and the criteria for assessing the sufficiency of the plan will be determined/tailored for each acquisition of essential services by the contracting officer in coordination with the functional manager. The contractor's written plan, including prices/cost, shall be considered and evaluated in conjunction with the technical evaluation of offers.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) Operational-specific contractor policies and requirements resulting from combatant commander “integrated planning” will be described in operation plans (OPLAN), operation orders (OPORD) or separate annexes, and must be incorporated into applicable contracts. The plans may include rules for theater entry, country clearance, use of weapons, living on-base, etc. Therefore, the requiring activity is responsible for obtaining pertinent OPLANs, OPORDs, and annexes (or unclassified extracts) from the affected combatant command or military service element or component and for ensuring that the contract is consistent with the theater OPLAN and OPORD. </p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) Ask the requiring activity to confirm that the appropriate personnel department has determined that inherently Governmental functions are not included in the contract requirements. If contract services will become inherently Governmental during a time of crisis, ensure that the contract states that work will be removed from the contract (temporarily or permanently) upon the occurrence of a triggering event (specified in the contract) or upon notice from the contracting officer that informs the contractor when its responsibility to perform affected duties will stop or restart. The contract should require the contractor to have a plan for restarting performance after the crisis ends. </p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">6</em>) If the combatant commander’s contingency plan requires military members to replace contractor employees during a crisis or contingency, acquisition planning must consider whether the contract should require the contractor to train military members to do that. </p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">7</em>) For acquisitions that have or may have some portion of delivery of items or performance in a foreign country, address considerations and requirements set forth in DFARS 225.370, Contracts requiring performance or delivery in a foreign country; <span class="ph PGIxref">

         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) If contract delivery of items or performance in support of contingency operations will or may occur in an austere, uncertain, or hostile environment, address the need for logistics support of contract administration and oversight personnel. </p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) When some portion of contract delivery of items or performance may take place in a contingency area, address pertinent combatant commander or joint force commander requirements and considerations for contract administration. Such requirements will be maintained on the particular combatant commander operational contract support website, http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/areas_of_responsibility.html .</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) When contracts are awarded for performance in a contingency area, the head of the contracting activity is responsible for planning to ensure that contingency contracts will be closed in a timely manner considering personnel turnover and preaward, contract administration, and other contracting workload. A plan for reachback support of contract closeouts should be included, if required.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">9</em>) For contracts that will incorporate the clause at DFARS 252.225-7040, Contractor Personnel Supporting U.S. Armed Forces Deployed Outside the United States, in accordance with DFARS 225.371-5(a), or otherwise require accountability for contractor personnel, consider the requirements and resources necessary for both the Government and contractor to keep the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) current in accordance with the SPOT business rules available at the website provided at http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/PS/ctr_mgt_accountability.html.</p>

When planning procurement support for theater security cooperation efforts (e.g., military exercises/training, base operations, weapons procurement, aviation fuels, construction, or the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief projects), planners should be aware that Department of State (DoS) missions (embassies and consulates) do not provide such contracting support; however, these missions can provide support for routine, non-complex services and supplies used by U.S. Government personnel, even if funded with foreign-military-sales case money (see DFARS PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">

         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) When DoS contracting support is determined to be unavailable or not allowed, ensure the party of DoD military and/or civilians deploying to support the particular Theater Security Cooperation effort either pre-arranges DoD contracting support through reach-back, if possible, or if necessary, includes a warranted contracting officer, field-ordering officer, or credit-card holder, and, if necessary, a paying agent.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(B) Is a suitable data package available with rights to use it for Government acquisition? (Note that breakout may be warranted even though competitive acquisition is not possible.)</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Can any quality control and reliability problems of the component be resolved without requiring effort by the end item contractor?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Will the component require further technical support (e.g., development of specifications, testing requirements, or quality assurance requirements)? If so, does the Government have the resources (manpower, technical competence, facilities, etc.) to provide such support? Or, can the support be obtained from the end item contractor (even though the component is broken out) or other source?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Will breakout impair logistics support (e.g., by jeopardizing standardization of components)?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Will breakout unduly fragment administration, management, or performance of the end item contract (e.g., by complicating production scheduling or preventing identification of responsibility for end item failure caused by a defective component)?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Can breakout be accomplished without jeopardizing delivery requirements of the end item?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) If a decision is made to break out a component, can advance acquisition funds be made available to provide the new source any necessary additional lead time?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(I) Is there a source other than the present manufacturer capable of supplying the component?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(J) Has the component been (or is it going to be) acquired directly by the Government as a support item in the supply system or as Government-furnished equipment in other end items?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(K) Will the financial risks and other responsibilities assumed by the Government after breakout be acceptable?</p>
         <p class="p List4">(L) Will breakout result in substantial net cost savings? Develop estimates of probable savings in cost considering all offsetting costs such as increases in the cost of requirements determination and control, contracting, contract administration, data package purchase, material inspection, qualification or preproduction testing, ground support and test equipment, transportation, security, storage, distribution, and technical support.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) If answers to the questions reveal conditions unfavorable to breakout, the program manager should explore whether the unfavorable conditions can be eliminated. For example, where adequate technical support is not available from Government resources, consider contracting for the necessary services from the end item contractor or other qualified source.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Records</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The contracting activity shall maintain records on components reviewed for breakout. Records should evidence whether the components—</p>
         <p class="p List4"></p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Have no potential for breakout;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Have been earmarked as potential breakout candidates; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Have been, or will be, broken out.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The program manager or other designated official must sign the records.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Records must reflect the facts and conditions of the case, including any assessment by the contractor, and the basis for the decision. The records must contain the assessments, calculations, and analyses discussed in paragraph 2 of this section, including the trade-off analysis between savings and increased risk to the Government because of responsibility for Government-furnished equipment.</p>
