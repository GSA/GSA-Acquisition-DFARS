      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p">To the extent that certified cost or pricing data are
not required by <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.403-4</span> and there
is no other means for the contracting officer to determine that
prices are fair and reasonable, the offeror is required to submit
“data other than certified cost or pricing data” (see definition
at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 2.101</span>). In accordance with<span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.403-3</span>(a), the offeror must provide
appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items
have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness
of the price. The following clarifies these requirements:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Data other than certified</em> 
            <em class="ph i">cost
or pricing data</em>. When certified cost or pricing data are not
required, the contracting officer must obtain whatever data is necessary
in order to determine the reasonableness of the price. The FAR defines
this as “data other than certified cost or pricing data.” When TINA
does not apply and there is no other means of determining that prices
are fair and reasonable, the contracting officer must obtain appropriate
data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been
sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the
price. Sales data must be comparable to the quantities, capabilities,
specifications, etc., of the product or service proposed. Sufficient
steps must be taken to verify the integrity of the sales data, to
include assistance from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other agencies if required.

            </span>).
Contracting Officers may rely on the confirmation and endorsement
of the offer from the Canadian Commercial Corporation at 225.870-3(a)
as an endorsement of the cost/price as no more than would be charged
to the Canadian government.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) When 252.215-7003 or 252.215-7004 are
included in a solicitation with the Canadian Commercial Corporation,
the data required by paragraph (b)(i) and (ii), in concert with
the confirmation and endorsement of the offer, is intended to meet
the requirements of <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.404-1</span> for documentation
of fair and reasonable pricing.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Use of 252.215-7003 or 252.215-7004
in sole source acquisitions not meeting the threshold at 215.408(2)(i)(A)
or (ii)(A)<em class="ph i">(1)</em> or competitive acquisitions at any dollar value
shall be supported by a determination and finding justifying the
anticipated need for data other than certified cost or pricing data
to determine a fair and reasonable price.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When the contracting officer anticipates
the need for additional data to establish a fair and reasonable
price, specific data should be requested at time of solicitation
as detailed in DFARS 252.215-7003.</p>
