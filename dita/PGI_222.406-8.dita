When such compliance assurance activities disclose potential violations that are substantial in amount (wage underpayments in excess of $1,000) or when requested by the Department of Labor, the contracting officer or a designee should take the following steps to ensure compliance with the investigative requirements of the Department of Labor:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Beginning of the investigation</i>. The investigator shall—</p>

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) Verify the exact legal name of the contractor, its address, and the names and titles of its principal officers;</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) Outline the general scope of the investigation, including the examination of pertinent records and the interview of employees;</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(D) Inform the contractor that the names of the employees to be interviewed will not be divulged to the contractor; and</p>

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) Interview of the complainant. If the investigation is based upon the receipt of a complaint, the investigator should interview the complainant unless this is impractical. The interview shall cover all aspects of the complaint to ensure that all pertinent information is obtained. Whenever an investigation does not include an interview of the complainant, explain such omission in the investigator's report.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) Interview of employees and former employees.</p>
