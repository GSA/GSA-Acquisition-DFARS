the award of the contract.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) This solicitation includes a FAR and
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause
for performance-based payments and a FAR clause for progress payments.
The resultant contract will include either performance-based payments

52.232-16 and its Alternate I. Even though the progress payments
clause is included in the contract, the clause shall be inoperative
during any time the contractor’s accounting system and controls
are determined by the Government to be inadequate for segregation
and accumulation of contract costs.</p>
