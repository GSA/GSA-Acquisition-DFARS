            <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">seq</i>.). The United States Munitions List (USML) identifies defense articles, services, and related technical data that are inherently military in character and could, if exported, jeopardize national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>

(The registration requirements are in Subpart 122.1 of the ITAR.

         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) NSDD 189 establishes a national policy that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled items, as defined in paragraph (a) of the clause at DFARS 252.225-7048.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research, whether basic, fundamental, or applied, from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or the regulations that implement those statutes (the ITAR and the EAR). Thus, if export-controlled items are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.</p>
