            (1), use the following provision:</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " outputclass="Ctr_SmCaps">ADVANCING SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH (JUN 2023)</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(a) This provision implements 10 U.S.C. 4959.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(b) The Offeror acknowledges by submission of its offer that by acceptance of the contract resulting from this solicitation, the Offeror may exceed the applicable small business size standard of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the contract and would no longer qualify as a small business concern for that NAICS code. Small business size standards matched to industry NAICS codes are published by the Small Business Administration and are available at 13 CFR 121.201 and https://www.sba.gov/document/support-table-size-standards. The Offeror is therefore encouraged to develop the capabilities and characteristics typically desired in contractors that are competitive as other-than-small contractors in this industry.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(c) For procurement technical assistance, the Offeror may contact the nearest APEX Accelerator. APEX Accelerator locations are available at <xref href="https://www.apexaccelerators.us"
