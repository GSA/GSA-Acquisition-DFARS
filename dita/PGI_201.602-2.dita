The link to the CORT Tool is https://wawf.eb.mil.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(v) A COR assists in the technical monitoring or administration of a contract.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) Contracting officers shall designate a COR for all service contracts, including both firm-fixed-price and other than firm-fixed-price contracts, awarded by a DoD component or by any other Federal agency on behalf of DoD. The surveillance activities performed by CORs should be tailored to the dollar value/complexity of the specific contract for which they are designated. For geographically dispersed large contracts with multiple task orders, contracting officers should consider appointing multiple or alternate CORs to assist with surveillance duties. These CORs should have specific duties based on criteria, such as geographic region or distinct task areas, to avoid conflicting or duplicative direction. Contracting officers may exempt service contracts from this requirement when the following three conditions are met:</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">1</i>) The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures;</p>
         <p outputclass="List6" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">2</i>) The requirement is not complex; and</p>
         <p outputclass="List6" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">3</i>) The contracting officer documents the file, in writing, with the specific reasons why the appointment of a COR is unnecessary.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) For cost reimbursement contracts that are not service contracts, contracting officers shall either retain or delegate surveillance activities to a COR or DCMA.</p>
