            (a)(1) shall be conducted only when—</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i)  A contractor has $50 million of qualifying sales to the Government during the contractor’s preceding fiscal year; and</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii)  The ACO, with advice from DCMA insurance/pension specialists and DCAA auditors, determines a CIPR is needed based on a risk assessment of the contractor’s past experience and current vulnerability.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2)  Qualifying sales are sales for which certified cost or pricing data were required under 10 U.S.C. 2306a, as implemented in FAR 15.403, or that are contracts priced on other than a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis.  Sales include prime contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to such contracts and subcontracts.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b)  A special CIPR that concentrates on specific areas of a contractor’s insurance programs, pension plans, or other deferred compensation plans shall be performed for a contractor (including, but not limited to, a contractor meeting the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section) when any of the following circumstances exists, but only if the circumstance(s) may result in a material impact on Government contract costs:</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1)  Information or data reveals a deficiency in the contractor's insurance/pension program.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2)  The contractor proposes or implements changes in its insurance, pension, or deferred compensation plans.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3)  The contractor is involved in a merger, acquisition, or divestiture.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4)  The Government needs to follow up on contractor implementation of prior CIPR recommendations.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c)  The DCAA auditor shall use relevant findings and recommendations of previously performed CIPRs in determining the scope of any audits of insurance and pension costs.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(d)  When a Government organization believes that a review of the contractor’s insurance/pension program should be performed, that organization should provide a recommendation for a review to the ACO.  If the ACO concurs, the review should be performed as part of an ACO-initiated special CIPR or as part of a CIPR already scheduled for the near future.</p>
