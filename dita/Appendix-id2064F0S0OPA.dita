         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(a) This Appendix I to 48 CFR Chapter 2 implements the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program (hereafter referred to as the “Program”) established under section 831 of Public Law 101-510, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2302 note), as amended through November 25, 2015. The purpose of the Program is to provide incentives to major DoD contractors to furnish eligible small business concerns with assistance designed to—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) Enhance the capabilities of eligible small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts and other contracts and subcontracts; and</p>

         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protege firms to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost reimbursement or credit against applicable subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the Program results in—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal agencies, and commercial contracts) from the date of their entry into the Program until 2 years after the conclusion of the agreement;</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(3) An increase in the employment level of protege firms from the date of entry into the Program until 2 years after the completion of the agreement.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) Reimbursement through a separate contract line item in a DoD contract or a separate contract with DoD; or</p>
