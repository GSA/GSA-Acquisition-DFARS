It continues upward at a slope of 50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.  At that point the plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) and ending there.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B)  The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone.  It then flares uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.</p>
