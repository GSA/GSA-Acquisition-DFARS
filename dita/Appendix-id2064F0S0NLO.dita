      <title>Rule 18. Suspensions; Dismissal Without Prejudice</title>
      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) The Board may suspend the proceedings by agreement of the parties for settlement discussions, or for good cause shown.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) In certain cases, appeals docketed before the Board are required to be placed in a suspense status and the Board is unable to proceed with disposition thereof for reasons not within the control of the Board. Where the suspension has continued, or may continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may dismiss such appeals from its docket for a period of time without prejudice to their restoration. Unless either party or the Board moves to reinstate the appeal within the time period set forth in the dismissal order, or if no time period is set forth, within one year from the date of the dismissal order, the dismissal shall be deemed to be with prejudice.</p>
