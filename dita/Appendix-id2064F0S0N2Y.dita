Contractors can print a RR or RRR from a system other than WAWF if a signed copy is required. In such cases, the contractor shall print the WAWF RR or RRR only after a signature is applied by the Government inspector or authorized acceptor in WAWF. Copies printed from the contractor’s system shall be annotated with “\\original signed in WAWF\\” in lieu of the inspector or acceptor’s signature. Ensure a copy is visible on the outside and one is placed inside the package.</p>
