         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(d)  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 6305, and in accordance with Presidential delegation dated October 3, 1995, Secretary of Defense delegation dated February 5, 1996, and Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) delegation dated February 23, 1996, the Director of Defense Procurement determined on May 10, 1996, that a need exists for DoD to agree not to reduce or set off any money due or to become due under the contract when the proceeds under the contract have been assigned in accordance with the Assignment of Claims provision of the contract.  This determination was published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1996, as required by law. Nevertheless, if departments/agencies decide it is in the Government's interest, or if the contracting officer makes a determination in accordance with <ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">FAR 32.803</ph>(d) concerning a significantly indebted offeror, they may exclude the no-setoff commitment.</p>
