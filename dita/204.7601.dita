         <p> “Item risk” means the probability that a product, based on intended
            use, will introduce performance risk resulting in safety issues,
            mission degradation, or monetary loss.</p>
         <p> “Price risk” means the measure of whether a proposed price for a
            product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for
            that item or service.</p>
         <p> “Supplier risk” means the probability that an award may subject the
            procurement to the risk of unsuccessful performance or to supply
            chain risk (see <xref href="239.7301.dita#DFARS_239.7301" outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly">239.7301</xref>).</p>
