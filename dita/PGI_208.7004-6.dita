      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Category I MIPRs. The requiring department will notify the acquiring department by electronic or other immediate means when cancelling all or part of the supplies or services requested in the MIPR. Within 30 days, the acquiring department will notify the requiring department of the quantity of items available for termination and the amount of funds in excess of the estimated settlement costs. Upon receipt of this information, the requiring department will issue a MIPR amendment to reduce the quantities and funds accordingly.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Category II MIPRs. The requiring department will notify the acquiring department electronically or by other immediate means when cancelling all or any part of the supplies or services requested in the MIPR.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) If the acquiring department has not entered into a contract for the supplies or services to be cancelled, the acquiring department will immediately notify the requiring department. Upon receipt of such notification, the requiring department shall initiate a MIPR amendment to revoke the estimated amount shown on the original MIPR for the cancelled items.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) If the items to be cancelled have already been placed under contractâ€”</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) As soon as practicable, but in no event more than 45 days after receipt of the cancellation notice from the requiring department, the contracting officer shall issue a termination data letter to the requiring department (original and four copies) containing, as a minimum, the information in Table 8-1, Termination Data Letter.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(B) The termination contracting officer (TCO) will review the proceedings at least every 60 days to reassess the Government's probable obligation. If any additional funds are excess to the probable settlement requirements, or if it appears that previous release of excess funds will result in a shortage of the amount that will be required for settlement, the TCO will promptly notify the contracting office which will amend the termination data letter. The requiring department will process a MIPR amendment to reflect the reinstatement of funds within 30 days after receiving the amended termination data letter.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(C) Upon receipt of a copy of the termination settlement agreement, the requiring department will prepare a MIPR amendment, if required, to remove any remaining excess funds.</p>

                        <p> (a) As termination action is now in progress on the
                           above contract, the following information is submitted:</p>

                           of $________ is available for release under the subject contract. This
                           sum represents the difference between $________, the value of items
                           terminated under the contract, and $________, estimated to be required
                           for settlement of the terminated contract. The estimated amount available
                           for release is allocated by the appropriations cited on the contract as
                           follows:</p>

                           amendment to MIPR ________ on DD Form 448-2 to reflect the reduced
                           quantity and amount of funds available for release.</p>
                        <p outputclass="List1">(c) Periodic reviews (not less
                           than 60 days) will be made as termination proceedings progress to
                           redetermine the Government's probable obligation.</p>
