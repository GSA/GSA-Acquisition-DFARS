         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(6) The primary factor in architect-engineer contractor selection is the determination of the most highly qualified firm. Also consider secondary factors such as geographic proximity and equitable distribution of work, but do not attribute greater significance to the secondary factors than to qualifications and past performance. Do not reject the overall most highly qualified firm solely in the interest of equitable distribution of contracts.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) Consider the volume of work awarded by DoD during the previous 12 months. In considering equitable distribution of work among architect-engineer firms, include small business concerns; historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions; firms that have not had prior DoD contracts; and small disadvantaged business concerns and joint ventures with small disadvantaged business participants if the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector of the acquisition is one in which use of a price evaluation adjustment is currently authorized (see <ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">FAR 19.201</ph>(b)).</p>

Do not consider awards to a subsidiary if the subsidiary is not normally subject to management decisions, bookkeeping, and policies of a holding or parent company or an incorporated subsidiary that operates under a firm name different from the parent company. This allows greater competition.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) Consider as appropriate superior performance evaluations on recently completed DoD contracts.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) Consider the extent to which potential contractors identify and commit to small business, to small disadvantaged business (SDB) if the NAICS Industry Subsector of the subcontracted effort is one in which use of an evaluation factor or subfactor for participation of SDB concerns is currently authorized (see <ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">FAR 19.201</ph>(b)), and to historically black college or university and minority institution performance as subcontractors.</p>
