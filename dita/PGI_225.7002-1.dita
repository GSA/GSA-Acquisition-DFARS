         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(5) Small arms protective inserts (SAPI plates) are an example of items added to, and not normally associated with, clothing. Therefore, SAPI plates are not covered under the Berry Amendment as clothing. However, fabrics used in the SAPI plate are still subject to the foreign source restrictions of the Berry Amendment. If the fabric used in the SAPI plate is a synthetic fabric or a coated synthetic fabric, the fibers and yarns used in the fabric are not covered by the Berry Amendment, because the fabric is a component of an end product that is not a textile product (see DFARS <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly"

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) As applied to hand or measuring tools, “produced in the United States” means that the hand or measuring tool was assembled in the United States out of components, or otherwise made from raw materials into the finished product that is to be provided to the Government.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) If a hand or measuring tool was assembled in a country other than the United States, then disassembled and reassembled in the United States, the hand or measuring tool was not produced in the United States.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) The requirement to buy hand or measuring tools produced in the United States does not impose any restriction on the source of the components of the hand or measuring tools. This is unlike the Berry Amendment restriction on clothing (see <ph xtrc="PGIxref" class="- topic/ph ">

            </ph>(a)(1)(ii)), which explicitly requires domestic source for the materials and components of clothing (other than unusual components such as sensors or electronics), as well as the additional separate restrictions on various types of fibers and fabrics that might be components of the clothing.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(D) If the acquisition of the hand or measuring tools is also subject to the Buy American statute (see FAR Subpart <ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">25.1</ph>), then in order to qualify as a domestic end product, the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States or a qualifying country, must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components of the hand or measuring tool.</p>
