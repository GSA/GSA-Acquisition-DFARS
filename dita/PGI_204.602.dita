         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Helpful documents</i>. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) website at https://www.fpds.gov provides useful documents and on-line training to assist with FPDS data entry. Key manuals can be found at the top of the website homepage under the “Training” and “Worksite” drop-down links to include:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">FPDS Data Element Dictionary</i>. The data dictionary outlines relevant information for each data field. The Data Dictionary identifies whether a data field is “Required,” “Optional,” “Propagates from the base action,” “Not Applicable,” or “System Generated,” for each type of data entry screen (Awards, Indefinite-Delivery Vehicles, and Transactions/Modifications). It also identifies the source of data entry (e.g., Contracting Officer, System for Award Management (SAM), FPDS); the format of the field; and whether the field input is derived from entries in other fields. At the back of the Data Dictionary is a useful summary.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">FPDS Data Validations</i>. This document identifies all the validation rules that are applied to data entry. The majority of the rules apply Governmentwide. DoD specific validation rules appear at “5.5.1 DoD Specific Validations.”</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(iii) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">FPDS Users Manual</i>. This manual provides guidance on the various types of data entry screens and addresses whether a particular field is: “[R]” – requires contracting officer/buyer entry; “[A]” – pre-populated by FPDS or a contract writing system, if using machine-to-machine process; or “[C]” – calculated by FPDS for each type of data entry screen. However, the nature of the field is determined based on Governmentwide requirements. To determine DoD-specific requirements, refer to J3 “DoD Use Case Summary” in the FPDS Data Element Dictionary. The FPDS User Manual is not a policy document; it is intended only for general guidance. Refer to this PGI section for specific FPDS reporting entries.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Reporting technical or policy issues</i>.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Technical issues</i>. To report an FPDS technical issue—</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A)(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">1</i>) Users of the Standard Procurement System (SPS) should contact their local SPS Help Desk (authorized SPS caller);</p>
         <p outputclass="List6" class="- topic/p ">(2) Users of other contract writing systems should contact the local contract writing system administrator to determine the appropriate procedures; and </p>
         <p outputclass="List6" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">3</i>) Web users should contact their local system administrator, who will then contact the FPDS Help Desk; or</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) If the issue is an obvious FPDS technical issue that needs to be documented and corrected by the system, the user should contact the Federal Service Desk (FSD), by telephone at 866-606-8220 (U.S. or DSN), or 334-206-7828 (International), or submit a comment or request at www.fsd.gov. When e-mailing FSD, also send a copy to the applicable agency representative identified in paragraph (2)(iii) of this section.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Policy issues</i>. Report policy issues to the applicable agency representative identified in paragraph (2)(iii) of this section.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(iii) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Agency representatives</i>. Department and component FPDS representatives and their contact information can be found on the DPC website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/federal_procurement_data_system_-_next_generation_fpds-ng.html under “Additional Resources.”</p>
