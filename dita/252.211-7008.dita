clause—</p>
         <p>“Government-assigned serial number” means a combination of letters
or numerals in a fixed human-readable information format (text)
conveying information about a major end item, which is provided
to a contractor by the requiring activity with accompanying technical
data instructions for marking the Government-assigned serial number
on major end items to be delivered to the Government.</p>
         <p>“Major end item” means a final combination of component parts
and/or materials which is ready for its intended use and of such
importance to operational readiness that review and control of inventory
management functions (procurement, distribution, maintenance, disposal,
and asset reporting) is required at all levels of life cycle management.
Major end items include aircraft; ships; boats; motorized wheeled,
tracked, and towed vehicles for use on highway or rough terrain;
weapon and missile end items; ammunition; and sets, assemblies,
or end items having a major end item as a component.</p>
         <p>“Unique item identifier (UII)” means a set of data elements permanently
marked on an item that is globally unique and unambiguous and never

its total life cycle. The term includes a concatenated UII or a
DoD-recognized unique identification equivalent.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The Contractor shall mark the Government-assigned
serial numbers on those major end items as specified by line item in
the Schedule, in accordance with the technical instructions for
the placement and method of application identified in the terms

         <p outputclass="List1">(d) The Contractor shall establish the

the Government-assigned serial number to construct the UII.</p>
