         <p>“Homogeneous material” means a material that cannot be mechanically disjointed into different materials and is of uniform composition throughout.</p>

         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Homogeneous material does not include conversion coatings that chemically modify the substrate.</p>
         <p>“Mechanically disjointed” means that the materials can, in principle, be separated by mechanical actions such as unscrewing, cutting, crushing, grinding, and abrasive processes.</p>

         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) Requires the removal or reapplication of hexavalent chromium materials during subsequent sustainment phases of the deliverable or construction material.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) This prohibition does not apply to hexavalent chromium produced as a by-product of manufacturing processes.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c) If authorization for incorporation of hexavalent chromium in a deliverable or construction material is required, the Contractor shall submit a request to the Contracting Officer.</p>
         <p>(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts, including subcontracts for commercial items, that are for supplies, maintenance and repair services, or construction materials.</p>
