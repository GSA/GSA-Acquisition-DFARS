         <p outputclass="List2">(1)  “Military flight simulator” means any system to simulate the form, fit, and function of a military aircraft that has no commonly available commercial variant.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2)  “Service contract” means any contract entered into by DoD, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees as defined in 41 U.S.C. 6701.</p>

         <p outputclass="List4">(D)  A best value determination of each alternative and a detailed explanation of the life-cycle cost calculations used in the determination.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c)  When reviewing requirements or participating in acquisition planning that would result in a military department or defense agency acquiring a military flight simulator, the contracting officer shall notify the program officials of the prohibition in paragraph (b) of this subsection.
