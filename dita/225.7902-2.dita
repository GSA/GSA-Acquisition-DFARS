         <p class="- topic/p ">The DTC Treaties permits the export of certain U.S. defense articles, technical data, and defense services, without U.S. export licenses or other written authorization under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) into and within the Approved Community, as long as the exports are in support of purposes specified in the DTC Treaties.  All persons must continue to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements outside of DFARS and ITAR concerning the import of defense articles and defense services or the possession or transfer of defense articles, including, but not limited to, regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found at 27 CFR Parts 447, 478, and 479, which are unaffected by the DTC Treaties.  The Approved Community consists of U.S. entities that are registered with the Department of State and are eligible exporters, the U.S. Government, and certain governmental and commercial facilities in Australia and the United Kingdom that are approved and listed by the U.S. Government.
