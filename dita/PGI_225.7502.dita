      <conbody>
         <p>If the Balance of Payments Program applies, use the following procedures:</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) <i>Solicitation of offers</i>. Identify, in the solicitation, supplies and construction material known in advance to be exempt from the Balance of Payments Program.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) <i>Evaluation of offers</i>. </p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) <i>Supplies</i>. Unless the entire acquisition is exempt from the Balance of Payments Program, evaluate offers for supplies that are subject to the Balance of Payments Program using the evaluation procedures in DFARS Subpart 225.5. However, treatment of duty may differ when delivery is overseas.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) Duty may not be applicable to nonqualifying country offers.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(B) The U.S. Government cannot guarantee the exemption of duty for components or end products imported into foreign countries.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(C) Foreign governments may impose duties. Evaluate offers including such duties as offered.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) <i>Construction</i>. Because the contracting officer evaluates the estimated cost of foreign and domestic construction material in accordance with DFARS <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.7501" href="225.7501.dita#DFARS_225.7501">225.7501</xref>(a)(6)(iv) before issuing the solicitation, no special procedures are required for evaluation of construction offers.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) <i>Postaward</i>. For construction contracts, the procedures at FAR 25.206, for noncompliance under the Buy American statute, also apply to noncompliance under the Balance of Payments Program.</p>
