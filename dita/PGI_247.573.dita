         <p outputclass="List6" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">1</i>)  Prior to granting an exception, the contracting officer shall request advice, oral or written, from the Commander, MSC, through the Contracts and Business Management Directorate, MSC (msc.n101.ffw@navy.mil), for voyage and time charters; or the USTRANSCOM Director of Acquisition, through the Sealift Services Division (transcom.scott.tcaq.mbx.i-foreign-flag-waiver@mail.mil), for ocean liner and intermodal transportation.</p>

         <p outputclass="List7" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">i</i>)  Take into consideration that the 1904 Act is, in part, a subsidy of the U.S.-flag commercial shipping industry that recognizes that lower prices may be available from foreign-flag carriers.  Therefore, a lower price for use of a foreign-flag vessel is not a sufficient basis, on its own, to determine that the freight rate proposed by the U.S.-flag carrier is excessive or otherwise unreasonable.  However, such a price differential may indicate a need for further review;</p>
