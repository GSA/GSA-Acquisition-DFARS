         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) Needed to fulfill the production plan, including reasonable quantities for scrap, shrinkage, yield, etc.; and</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) Charged/billed to contracts or other cost objectives in a manner consistent with the need to fulfill the production plan.</p>

         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(d) System criteria. The MMAS shall have adequate internal controls to ensure system and data integrity, and shall—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) Have an adequate system description including policies, procedures, and operating instructions that comply with the FAR and Defense FAR Supplement;</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(3) Provide a mechanism to identify, report, and resolve system control weaknesses and manual override. Systems should identify operational exceptions, such as excess/residual inventory, as soon as known;</p>

         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) The Contractor shall maintain and disclose written policies describing the transfer methodology and the loan/pay-back technique.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). The Contractor shall maintain consistency across all contract and customer types, and from accounting period to accounting period for initial charging and transfer charging.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction using a loan/pay-back technique. The “loan/pay-back technique” means that the physical part is moved temporarily from the contract, but the cost of the part remains on the contract. The procedures for the loan/pay-back technique must be approved by the ACO. When the technique is used, the Contractor shall have controls to ensure—</p>
