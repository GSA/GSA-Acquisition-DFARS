         <p class="- topic/p ">“Acceptable material management and accounting system” means a material management and accounting system that generally complies with the system criteria in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p "> “Contractor” means a business unit as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p "> “Material management and accounting system (MMAS)” means the Contractor’s system or systems for planning, controlling, and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing, and disposition of material. Material management and accounting systems may be manual or automated. They may be stand-alone systems, or they may be integrated with planning, engineering, estimating, purchasing, inventory, accounting, or other systems.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p "> “Material weakness” means a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in the internal control over information in contractor business systems, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of such information will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A reasonable possibility exists when the likelihood of an event occurring is—</p>

         <p class="- topic/p " outputclass="List3">(i) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower accuracy levels; and</p>

         <p class="- topic/p " outputclass="List3">(ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). The Contractor shall maintain consistency across all contract and customer types, and from accounting period to accounting period for initial charging and transfer charging.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " outputclass="List3">(iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction using a loan/pay-back technique. The “loan/pay-back technique” means that the physical part is moved temporarily from the contract, but the cost of the part remains on the contract. The procedures for the loan/pay-back technique must be approved by the ACO. When the technique is used, the Contractor shall have controls to ensure—</p>
