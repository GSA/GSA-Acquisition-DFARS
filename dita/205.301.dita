         <p outputclass="List2">(i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2533a(k), contracting officers also must synopsize through the GPE, awards exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that are for the acquisition of any clothing, fiber, yarn, or fabric items described in <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.7002-1" href="225.7002-1.dita#DFARS_225.7002-1">225.7002-1</xref>(a)(1)(ii) through (x), if -</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(A) The Secretary concerned has determined that domestic items are not available, in accordance with <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.7002-2" href="225.7002-2.dita#DFARS_225.7002-2">225.7002-2</xref>(b); or</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(B) The acquisition is for chemical warfare protective clothing, and the contracting officer has determined that an exception to domestic source requirements applies because the acquisition furthers an agreement with a qualifying country, in accordance with <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.7002-2" href="225.7002-2.dita#DFARS_225.7002-2">225.7002-2</xref>(n).</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(ii) The synopsis must be submitted in sufficient time to permit its publication not later than 7 days after contract award.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(iii) In addition to the information otherwise required in a synopsis of contract award, the synopsis must include one of the following statements as applicable:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(A) “The exception at DFARS <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.7002-2" href="225.7002-2.dita#DFARS_225.7002-2">225.7002-2</xref>(b) applies to this acquisition, because the Secretary concerned has determined that items grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States cannot be acquired as and when needed in satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity at U.S. market prices.”</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(B) “The exception at DFARS <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.7002-2" href="225.7002-2.dita#DFARS_225.7002-2">225.7002-2</xref>(n) applies to this acquisition, because the contracting officer has determined that this acquisition of chemical warfare protective clothing furthers an agreement with a qualifying country identified in DFARS <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-225.003" href="225.003.dita#DFARS_225.003">225.003</xref>(10).”</p>
