             does not apply to critical defense applications if no substitute can meet performance requirements.  The DoD policy of April 8, 2009, “Minimizing the Use of Hexavalent Chromium,” contains requirements for weighing hexavalent chromium versus substitutes.  DoD Program Managers must consider the following factors—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1)  Cost effectiveness of alternative materials or processes;</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2)   Technical feasibility of alternative materials or processes;</p>

         <p outputclass="List2">(4)  Achieving a DoD Manufacturing Readiness Level of at least eight for any qualified alternative;</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(5)  Materiel availability of hexavalent chromium and the proposed alternatives over the projected life span of the system; and</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(6)  Corrosion performance difference of alternative materials or processes as determined by agency corrosion subject matter experts.</p>
