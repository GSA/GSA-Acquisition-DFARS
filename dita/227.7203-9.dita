The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause.  When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license.  Do not negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license.  For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in technical data license.</p>

Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.</p>
