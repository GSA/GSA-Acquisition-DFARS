(The Munitions List and pertinent procedures are set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR, et seq.)  Before authorizing such exportation, the Department of State generally requests comments from the Department of Defense.  On request of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), each Department shall submit comments thereon as the basis for a Department of Defense reply to the Department of State.</p>
