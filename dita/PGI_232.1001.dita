Performance-based payments are not practical for use on all fixed price contracts and require considerable effort between the contractor and Government to identify the appropriate performance-based payment events and establish the proper completion criteria for those events. Additionally, <ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">FAR 32.1003</ph> prohibits contracts from having both progress payments and performance-based payment financing on a contract at the same time.
