officer action</i>. Performance-based payments are not practical
for use on all fixed price contracts and require considerable effort
between the contractor and Government to identify the appropriate
performance-based payment events and establish the proper completion
criteria for those events. Additionally, FAR 32.1003 prohibits contracts
from having both progress payments and performance-based payment
financing on a contract at the same time. Additional information and
instruction on performance-based payments are provided in the DoD
Performance-based Payments Guide on the DPC website in the Price, Cost and Finance
section under the Performance Based Payments â€“ Guidebook and Analysis
