Performance-based payments are not practical for use on all fixed<ph rev="Revised October 30, 2023">-</ph>price contracts and require considerable effort between the contractor and Government to identify the appropriate performance-based payment events and establish the proper completion criteria for those events. Additionally, FAR 32.1003 prohibits contracts from having both progress payments and performance-based payment financing on a contract at the same time. Additional information and instruction on performance-based payments are provided in the DoD Performance-based Payments Guide on the <ph rev="Revised October 30, 2023">Defense Pricing and Contracting (Price, Cost and Finance)</ph> website <ph rev="Revised October 30, 2023">under Pricing Topics, Performance Based Payment.</ph>
