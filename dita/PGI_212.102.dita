In these situations, the documentation must clearly detail the particulars of the modifications and sales offers.

Within 30 days of making a commercial item determination, the contracting officer shall e-mail the commercial item determination to DCMA CIG at dcma.boston-ma.eastern-rc.mbx.Commercial@mail.mil so that it can be uploaded by the CIG to the DoD Commercial Item Database.</p>
