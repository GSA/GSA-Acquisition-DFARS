Particular care must be taken when documenting determinations involving
“modifications of a type customarily available in the marketplace,”
and items only “offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public”
but not yet actually sold, leased, or licensed. In these situations,
the documentation must clearly detail the particulars of the modifications
and sales offers. When such items lack sufficient market pricing history,
additional diligence must be given to determinations that prices
are fair and reasonable as required by FAR subpart 15.4.</ph>
