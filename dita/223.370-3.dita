      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a)  DoD policy is to ensure that its contractors take reasonable precautions in handling ammunition and explosives so as to minimize the potential for mishaps.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b)  This policy is implemented by DoD 4145.26-M, DoD Contractors' Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives, which is incorporated into contracts under which ammunition and explosives are handled.  The manual contains mandatory safety requirements for contractors.  When work is to be performed on a Government-owned installation, the contracting officer may use the ammunition and explosives regulation of the DoD component or installation as a substitute for, or supplement to, DoD 4145.26-M, as long as the contract cites these regulations.</p>
