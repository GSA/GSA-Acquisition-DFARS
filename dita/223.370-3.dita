The manual contains mandatory safety requirements for contractors.  When work is to be performed on a Government-owned installation, the contracting officer may use the ammunition and explosives regulation of the DoD component or installation as a substitute for, or supplement to, DoD 4145.26-M, as long as the contract cites these regulations.</p>
