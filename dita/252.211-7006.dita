         <p class="- topic/p ">“Advance shipment notice” means an electronic notification used to list the contents of a shipment of goods as well as additional information relating to the shipment, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID) or item unique identification (IUID) information, order information, product description, physical characteristics, type of packaging, marking, carrier information, and configuration of goods within the transportation equipment.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Bulk commodities” means the following commodities, when shipped in rail tank cars, tanker trucks, trailers, other bulk wheeled conveyances, or pipelines:</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1)  Sand.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2)  Gravel.</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(6)  Agricultural products such as seeds, grains, or animal feed.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Case” means either a MIL-STD-129 defined exterior container within a palletized unit load or a MIL-STD-129 defined individual shipping container.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Electronic Product Code™ (EPC)” means an identification scheme for universally identifying physical objects via RFID tags and other means.  The standardized EPC data consists of an EPC (or EPC identifier) that uniquely identifies an individual object, as well as an optional filter value when judged to be necessary to enable effective and efficient reading of the EPC tags.  In addition to this standardized data, certain classes of EPC tags will allow user-defined data.  The EPC Tag Data Standards will define the length and position of this data, without defining its content.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“EPCglobal®” means a subscriber-driven organization comprised of industry leaders and organizations focused on creating global standards for the adoption of passive RFID technology.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Exterior container” means a MIL-STD-129 defined container, bundle, or assembly that is sufficient by reason of material, design, and construction to protect unit packs and intermediate containers and their contents during shipment and storage.  It can be a unit pack or a container with a combination of unit packs or intermediate containers.  An exterior container may or may not be used as a shipping container.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Palletized unit load” means a MIL-STD-129 defined quantity of items, packed or unpacked, arranged on a pallet in a specified manner and secured, strapped, or fastened on the pallet so that the whole palletized load is handled as a single unit.  A palletized or skidded load is not considered to be a shipping container.  A loaded 463L System pallet is not considered to be a palletized unit load.  Refer to the Defense Transportation Regulation, DoD 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 203, for marking of 463L System pallets.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Passive RFID tag” means a tag that reflects energy from the reader/interrogator or that receives and temporarily stores a small amount of energy from the reader/interrogator signal in order to generate the tag response.  The only acceptable tags are EPC Class 1 passive RFID tags that meet the EPCglobal™ Class 1 Generation 2 standard.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Radio frequency identification (RFID)” means an automatic identification and data capture technology comprising one or more reader/interrogators and one or more radio frequency transponders in which data transfer is achieved by means of suitably modulated inductive or radiating electromagnetic carriers.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">“Shipping container” means a MIL-STD-129 defined exterior container that meets carrier regulations and is of sufficient strength, by reason of material, design, and construction, to be shipped safely without further packing (e.g., wooden boxes or crates, fiber and metal drums, and corrugated and solid fiberboard boxes).</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(b)(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall affix passive RFID tags, at the case- and palletized-unit-load packaging levels, for shipments of items that—</p>
