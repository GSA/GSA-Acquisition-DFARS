for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Purpose</i>. The DD Form 1861 provides
a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted
Guidelines Application. It—</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) Enables the contracting officer to
differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land,
buildings, equipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead
rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract
overhead costs.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) Is designed to record and compute
the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed
which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Completion instructions</i>. Complete
a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal,
establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation
objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) List overhead pools and direct-charging
service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on
the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure
and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three
displays.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead
allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown
or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead
pool and direct-charging service center.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(iii) Multiply each allocation base by
its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital
cost of money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these
products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of
money for the year's effort.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(iv) Total contract facilities cost of
money is the sum of the yearly amounts.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(v) Since the facilities capital cost of
money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column
1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same
rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(d) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Preaward facilities capital applications</i>.
To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital
cost of money and capital employed as follows:</p>

         </p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Cost Objective</i>. Use the imputed
facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to
establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an
incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established
at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available
during the period of contract performance.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Profit Objective</i>. When measuring
the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation
profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs.
Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Facilities Capital Employed</i>.

the contracting officer—</p>

facilities capital to the goods or services being acquired under
the prospective contract;</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements
and other anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from
the facilities capital investment, including—</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) The economic value of the facilities
capital, such as physical age, undepreciated value, idleness, and
expected contribution to future defense needs; and</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) The contractor's level of investment
in defense related facilities as compared with the portion of the
contractor's total business that is derived from DoD; and</p>

termination protection clauses and capital investment indemnification.</p>

technology that reduce acquisition cost or yield other tangible

benefits in efficiency and significantly reduced acquisition costs

little benefit to DoD. Indicators are—</p>

to commercial item lines;</p>

furniture and fixtures, home or group level administrative offices,
corporate aircraft and hangars, gymnasiums; or</p>

defense manufacturing is done in an environment characterized by
outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive capital equipment.</p>
