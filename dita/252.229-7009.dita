Therefore, the procedures outlined in HM Customs and Excise Notice No. 431B, August 1982, and any amendment thereto, shall be used to obtain relief from both customs duty and value added tax for fuel used under the contract.  These procedures shall apply to both loaded and unloaded miles.  The unit prices shall be based on the recoupment by the Contractor of customs duty in accordance with the following allowances:</p>
