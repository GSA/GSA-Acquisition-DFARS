close out contracts or groups of contracts through issuance of one
or more modifications to such contracts without completing a reconciliation

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) Was entered into on a date that is
at least 17 fiscal years before the current fiscal year;</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) Has no further supplies or services

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) Has been determined by a contracting

not otherwise reconcilable, because—</p>

contract, including those contracts that are closed out in accordance
with a negotiated settlement.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) For a contract or groups of contracts,
the contracting officer shall prepare a negotiation settlement memorandum that

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) For a group of contracts, a bilateral
modification of at least one contract shall be made to reflect the
negotiated settlement for a group of contracts, and unilateral modifications
may be made, as appropriate, to other contracts in the group to
reflect the negotiated settlement.</p>
