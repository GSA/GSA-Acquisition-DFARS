         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(e)(1)(A) In special circumstances, a contract
administration office may request support from a component not listed
in the Federal Directory of Contract Administration Services Components
(available via the Internet at 
               <xref href="https://piee.eb.mil/pcm/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml" format="html" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">https://piee.eb.mil/pcm/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml</xref>
            ).
An example is a situation where the contractor's work site is on
a military base and a base organization is asked to provide support.
Before formally sending the request, coordinate with the office
concerned to ensure that resources are available for, and capable
of, providing the support.</p>
