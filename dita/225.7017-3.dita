      <conbody>
         <p>DoD requires the contractor to utilize domestic photovoltaic
devices in covered contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition
threshold, with the following exceptions:</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) <i>Qualifying country.</i>Qualifying
country photovoltaic devices may be utilized in any covered contract,
because <xref href="225.103.dita#DFARS_225.103" base="DFARS-225.103" outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly">225.103</xref> (a)(i)(A) provides
an exception to the Buy American statute for products of qualifying
countries, as defined in <xref href="225.003.dita#DFARS_225.003" base="DFARS-225.003" outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly">225.003</xref> . </p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) Buy American—unreasonable cost. For
a covered contract that utilizes photovoltaic devices valued at
less than $183,000, the
exception for unreasonable cost may apply (see FAR 25.103(c). If
the cost of a foreign photovoltaic device plus 50 percent is less
than the cost of a domestic photovoltaic device, then the foreign
photovoltaic device may be utilized.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c) <i>Trade agreements.</i>
         </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Free Trade Agreements. For a covered
contract that utilizes photovoltaic devices valued at $25,000 or
more, photovoltaic devices may be utilized from a country covered
under the acquisition by a Free Trade Agreement, depending upon
dollar threshold (see FAR subpart 25.4).</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) World Trade Organization—Government
Procurement Agreement. For covered contracts that utilize photovoltaic devices
that are valued at $183,000 or
more, only U.S.-made photovoltaic devices, designated country photovoltaic devices,
or qualifying country photovoltaic devices may be utilized.</p>
