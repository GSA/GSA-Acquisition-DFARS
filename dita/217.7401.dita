         <p>“Definitization” means the agreement on, or determination of, contract terms, specifications, and price, which converts the undefinitized contract action to a definitive contract.</p>
         <p>“Qualifying proposal” means a proposal that contains sufficient information to enable DoD to conduct meaningful analyses and audits of the information contained in the proposal.</p>
         <p>“Undefinitized contract action” means any contract action for which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon before performance is begun under the action.  Examples are letter contracts, orders under basic ordering agreements, and provisioned item orders, for which the price has not been agreed upon before performance has begun.
