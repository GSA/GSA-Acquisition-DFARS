         <p class="- topic/p ">To the extent that certified cost or pricing data are
not required by FAR
15.403-4 and there is no other means for the contracting officer
to determine that prices are fair and reasonable, the offeror is
required to submit “data other than certified cost or pricing data”
(see definition at FAR
2.101). In accordance with FAR 15.403-3(a), the offeror must
provide appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar
items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness
of the price. The following clarifies these requirements:</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Data other than certified</i>
            <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">cost
or pricing data</i>. When certified cost or pricing data are not
required, the contracting officer must obtain whatever data is necessary
in order to determine the reasonableness of the price. The FAR defines
this as “data other than certified cost or pricing data.” When TINA
does not apply and there is no other means of determining that prices
are fair and reasonable, the contracting officer must obtain appropriate
data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been
sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the
price. Sales data must be comparable to the quantities, capabilities,
specifications, etc., of the product or service proposed. Sufficient
steps must be taken to verify the integrity of the sales data, to
include assistance from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other agencies if required.
See PGI 215.404-1 (DFARS/PGI view) for more detailed procedures
for obtaining data from offerors to determine price reasonableness.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) Previously been sold. Contracting officers
shall request offerors to provide data related to prior sales (or
“offered for sale”) in support of price reasonableness determinations.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(3) Adequacy of sales data for pricing.
The contracting officer must determine if the prior sales data is
sufficient for determining that prices are fair and reasonable.
If the sales data is not sufficient, additional data shall be obtained,
including cost data if necessary. See PGI 215.404-1 (DFARS/PGI view)
for more detailed procedures for obtaining whatever data is needed
to determine fair and reasonable prices.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(4) Reliance on prior prices paid by the
Government. Before relying on a prior price paid by the Government,
the contracting officer must verify and document that sufficient
analysis was performed to determine that the prior price was fair
and reasonable. Sometimes, due to exigent situations, supplies or
services are purchased even though an adequate price or cost analysis
could not be performed. The problem is exacerbated when other contracting
officers assume these prices were adequately analyzed and determined
to be fair and reasonable. The contracting officer also must verify
that the prices previously paid were for quantities consistent with
the current solicitation. Not verifying that a previous analysis
was performed, or the consistencies in quantities, has been a recurring
issue on sole source commercial items reported by oversight organizations.
Sole source commercial items require extra attention to verify that
previous prices paid on Government contracts were sufficiently analyzed
and determined to be fair and reasonable. At a minimum, a contracting
officer reviewing price history shall discuss the basis of previous
prices paid with the contracting organization that previously bought
the item. These discussions shall be documented in the contract
file.</p>
