data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been
sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the
price. Sales data must be comparable to the quantities, capabilities,
specifications, etc., of the product or service proposed. Sufficient
steps must be taken to verify the integrity of the sales data, to
include assistance from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other agencies if required.
