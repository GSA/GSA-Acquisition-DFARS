prices are fair and reasonable, the offeror is required to submit
“data other than certified cost or pricing data” (see definition
at <ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">FAR 2.101</ph>). In accordance with<ph xtrc="FARxref" class="- topic/ph ">FAR 15.403-3</ph>(a), the offeror must provide
appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items
have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness
of the price. The following clarifies these requirements:</p>

            <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">cost
or pricing data</i>. When certified cost or pricing data are not
required, the contracting officer must obtain whatever data is necessary
in order to determine the reasonableness of the price. The FAR defines
this as “data other than certified cost or pricing data.” When TINA
does not apply and there is no other means of determining that prices
are fair and reasonable, the contracting officer must obtain appropriate
data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been
sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the
price. Sales data must be comparable to the quantities, capabilities,
specifications, etc., of the product or service proposed. Sufficient
steps must be taken to verify the integrity of the sales data, to
include assistance from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other agencies if required.
