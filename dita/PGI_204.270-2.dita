To facilitate this review process, all feeds of data to EDA in the Procurement Data Standard are initially placed in a view only evaluation mode, where the data is not available to other systems or outside users pending verification. Upon completion of the review of data, contracting organizations shall notify the EDA program office of the results of the review, with a list of the issuing offices of the contractual actions, the identifier of the system sending the actions, the version or versions of the data standards to which the review applies, and the locations of the systems sending the actions, directing one of the following decisions—</p>

After resolution of a CDR, the initiator of the CDR can accept the resolution and manually close the CDR or return it to the assignee for further action. CDRs not manually closed or returned by the initiator to the assignee within 60 days after resolution will automatically be closed. Once the CDR is closed, a notification is generated advising that the CDR is closed.</p>
