      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a)  Price FMS contracts using the same principles used in pricing other defense contracts.  However, application of the pricing principles in FAR Parts 15 and 31 to an FMS contract may result in prices that differ from other defense contract prices for the same item due to the considerations in this section.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b)  If the foreign government has conducted a competition resulting in adequate price competition (see FAR 15.403-1(b)(1)), the contracting officer shall not require the submission of certified cost or pricing data. The contracting officer should consult with the foreign government through security assistance personnel to determine if adequate price competition has occurred.</p>
