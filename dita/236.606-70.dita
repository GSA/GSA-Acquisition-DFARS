percent of the project's estimated construction cost.</p>
         <p id="XPwOAw" outputclass="List1">(b) The six percent limit
also applies to contract modifications, including modifications
involving—</p>
         <p id="gVQMVk" outputclass="List2">(1) Work not initially included

the six percent limit as follows—</p>
         <p id="MLlEoq" outputclass="List3">(i) Add the estimated construction
cost of the redesign features to the original estimated construction
cost;</p>
         <p id="RKXhfi" outputclass="List3">(ii) Add the contract cost
for the original design to the contract cost for redesign; and</p>
         <p id="pOqxaD" outputclass="List3">(iii) Divide the total contract
design cost by the total estimated construction cost. The resulting
percentage may not exceed the six percent statutory limitation.</p>
         <p id="AwcQyM" outputclass="List1">(c) The six percent limit
applies only to that portion of the contract (or modification) price
attributable to the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and
specifications. If a contract or modification also includes other
services, the part of the price attributable to the other services
is not subject to the six percent limit.</p>
