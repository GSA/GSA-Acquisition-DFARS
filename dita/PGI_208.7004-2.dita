If the 30 day time limit cannot be met, the acquiring department must inform the requiring department of the reason for the delay, and the anticipated date the MIPR will be accepted. The acquiring department must accept MIPRs in writing before expiration of the funds.</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(4) When the MIPR is accepted for Category II funding, a conformed copy of the contract (see DFARS 204.802(1)(ii)) is the authority to record the obligation.

The acquiring department will immediately notify the requiring department of the excess funds by submitting an Acceptance of MIPR (DD Form 448-2).
