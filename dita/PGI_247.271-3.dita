Carrier demurrage/detention rules usually allow a period of free time for loading, unloading, or holding equipment.</p>

Contracting officers should specifically address them in the contract.  While demurrage/detention rules are published in individual carrier tariffs or agency tenders, Contracting Officers may negotiate contract-specific demurrage/detention rules and charges independent of any existing tariffs or tenders.</p>
