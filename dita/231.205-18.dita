         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i)  “Covered contract” means a DoD prime contract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price contract without cost incentives.  The term also includes a subcontract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime contract.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(ii)  “Covered segment” means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&amp;D/B&amp;P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.  In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole.  A product division of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this subsection.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(iii)  “Major contractor” means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.  For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
