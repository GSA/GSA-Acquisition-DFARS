Secondary contract administration delegations are appropriate when, for example, contract work is performed at locations geographically separated from the contract administration office. In lieu of transferring contract administration responsibility through a secondary contract administration delegation, a GFR from one unit may be delegated GFR responsibility from an outside contract administration organization that has retained contract administration responsibility. This is accomplished through the use of a formal letter of agreement functionally assigning the GFR to the outside contract administration organization for the limited purpose of performing contract administration under FAR <xref scope="external"
