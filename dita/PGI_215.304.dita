L. 111-383 to exclude a source based on supply chain risk requires an evaluation factor for supply chain risk, as specified at DFARS 239.73. Evaluating supply chain risk requires review of the supply chain, including all information technology subcontractors and suppliers that are proposed for use at any time in the performance of the contract and may involve the use of all-source intelligence information. The requiring activity is responsible for obtaining any necessary all-source intelligence information and must inform the contracting officer and source selection authority of the results of the review for use in evaluating offers.</p>
