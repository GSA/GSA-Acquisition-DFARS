         <p outputclass="List3">(i) The component or spare part is intended for—</p>

         <p id="DFARS" outputclass="List1">(d) <i>Relevant information</i>. See <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly" base="DFARS-212.209" href="212.209.dita#DFARS_212.209">212.209</xref>(a) for requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2377 with regard to market research.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) To the extent necessary to make a determination of price reasonableness, the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit prices paid for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request the offeror to submit information on—</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) Prices paid for the same or similar items under different terms and conditions;</p>

However, no uncertified cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) An offeror shall not be required to submit information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with regard to a commercially available off-the-shelf item. An offeror may be required to submit such information with regard to any other item that was developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(5) An offeror may submit information or analysis relating to the value of a commercial item to aid in the determination of the reasonableness of the price of such item. A contracting officer may consider such information or analysis in addition to the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. For additional guidance see PGI 234.7002(d)(5).</p>
