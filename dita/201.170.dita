         <p id="ddbkjry" outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">
            (A) If the not-to-exceed amount
for an undefinitized contract action or an unpriced change order
exceeds the peer review threshold, then the resultant definitization
modification(s) will be subject to peer review regardless of actual
performance up to the point of definitization.

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">
            (B) For indefinite delivery
indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts that will establish pricing
terms that apply to orders, use the total maximum dollar value for
purposes of the peer review threshold. IDIQ contracts that will
not establish pricing terms in the basic contract are not subject
to peer review, but individual orders that exceed the threshold are
subject to peer review.
