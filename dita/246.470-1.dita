         <p outputclass="List2">(2)  Demand payment of the costs in accordance with the collection procedures contained in FAR Subpart 32.6.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c)  In making a determination to assess additional costs, the contracting officer shall consider—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1)  The frequency of delays, reinspection, or retest under both current and prior contracts;</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2)  The cause of such delay, reinspection, or retest; and</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3)  The expense of recovering the additional costs.</p>
