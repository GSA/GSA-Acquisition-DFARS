The examples assume that the contracting officer has eliminated all offers that are unacceptable for reasons other than price or a trade agreement and that price is the determining factor in contract award. The same evaluation procedures and the 50 percent evaluation factor apply regardless of whether the acquisition is subject to the Buy American Act (BAA) or the Balance of Payments Program (BOPP).</p>

         <p class="- topic/p " outputclass="List2">Offer A $945,000 Foreign offer subject to BAA/BOPP</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " outputclass="List2">Offer B $950,000 Foreign offer exempt from BAA/BOPP</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Since no domestic offers are received, do not apply the evaluation factor. Award on Offer A.</p>
