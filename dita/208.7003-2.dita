         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(f)  Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR Part 35).  Under this exception, the military departments may contract for research and development requirements, including quantities for testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in actual production, but beyond prototype).  Generally, this exception applies only when research and development funds are used.</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1)  This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to any item which requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2)  This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject to the special testing procedures.</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1)  This exception permits the requiring department to contract for items of highly unstable design.  For use of this exception, it must be clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the acquisition to the acquiring department.  Anticipation that contracting by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason for using this exception.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2)  This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between industry and the requiring department;</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1)  This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item.  This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2)  This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.</p>
