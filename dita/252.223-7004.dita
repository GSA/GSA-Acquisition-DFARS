         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1)  “Employee in a sensitive position,” as used in this clause, means an employee who has been granted access to classified information; or employees in other positions that the Contractor determines involve national security, health or safety, or functions other than the foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and confidence.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2)  “Illegal drugs,” as used in this clause, means controlled substances included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) of Title 21 of the United States Code, the possession of which is unlawful under Chapter 13 of that Title.  The term “illegal drugs” does not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses authorized by law.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(b)  The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for achieving the objective of a drug-free work force.

         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">(i)  The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions.  The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.</p>

         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(d)  Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal with employees who are found to be using drugs illegally.  Contractors shall not allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs until such time as the Contractor, in accordance with procedures established by the Contractor, determines that the employee may perform in such a position.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(e)  The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing programs shall not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local law, or with an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that with respect to the latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that are in conflict will be a subject of negotiation at the next collective bargaining session.</p>
