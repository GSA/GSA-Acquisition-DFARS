         <p outputclass="List2">(4) For samarium-cobalt magnets contained

         <p outputclass="List2">(5) Domestic specialty metals nonavailable
as and when needed.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) Determining availability.</p>
         <p outputclass="List6">(<i>1</i>) FAR 15.402 requires that contracting
officers purchase supplies and services at fair and reasonable prices. Thus,
contracting officers must determine whether any increase in contract
price that results from providing compliant specialty metal is fair
and reasonable, given the circumstances of the particular situation. In
those cases where the contracting officer determines that the price
would not be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of the military
department concerned may use that information in determining whether
the unreasonable price causes the compliant metal to be effectively
“nonavailable.” Where these “reasonableness” limits should be drawn
is a case-by-case decision.</p>
         <p outputclass="List6">(<i>2</i>) A similar approach may be used
to determine whether delays associated with incorporating compliant
specialty metals into items being acquired results in the metals
being effectively nonavailable.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(B)(1) A department or agency requesting
a determination or approval from USD(A&amp;S) in accordance with
DFARS 225.7003-3(b)(5) shall submit the request, including the proposed

Contracting ATTN: OUSD(A&amp;S) DPC/CP3060 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC

         <p outputclass="List6">(2) The Principal Director, Defense Pricing
and Contracting, will forward the request to USD(A&amp;S) as appropriate.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(C) For domestic nonavailability determinations
with regard to samarium-cobalt high performance magnets, see paragraph
(b)(6)(D) of this section.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(6) Application of specialty metals restrictions
to magnets.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) The two most common types of high performance
magnets are samarium-cobalt magnets and neodymium-iron-boron magnets.
Only samarium-cobalt magnets contain specialty metals and are subject
to the restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 2533b in this section, as well
as the restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 2533c at

            .
Neodymium-iron-boron magnets are only subject to the restrictions
of 10 U.S.C. 2533c at
