         <p id="XhyxMR" outputclass="List1">(b) <ph id="216obp7d" rev="Revised April 28, 2022">
               <i>Commercial items–p<i>resumption regarding development exclusively at private expense</i>.</i>
            </ph>The Contracting Officer will presume that the Contractor’s or a subcontractor’s asserted use or release restrictions with respect to a commercial item are justified on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense. The Contracting Officer will not <ph id="bfp2ac2" rev="Revised April 28, 2022">issue a</ph> challenge unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion developed exclusively at private expense.</p>
         <p id="yBBwpA" outputclass="List1">(c) <i>Justification.</i> The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>

         <p id="rooTmx" outputclass="List2">(1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.</p>
         <p id="HkMnPO" outputclass="List2">(2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer <ph id="g4nn0rzh" rev="Revised April 28, 2022">will</ph> follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>
         <p id="PHpWbm" outputclass="List2">(3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>

         <p id="xkJKGk" outputclass="List3">(iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.</p>

The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, <ph id="k1o4p589" rev="Revised April 28, 2022">will</ph> formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule <ph id="17jkxq7l" rev="Revised April 28, 2022">will</ph> afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.</p>

Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>
         <p id="UZlCGz" outputclass="List3">(iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court.
