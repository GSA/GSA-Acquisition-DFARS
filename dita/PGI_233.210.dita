      <conbody>
         <p>When it would be helpful in reviewing the current claim, the contracting officer should get information on claims previously filed by the contractor. Such information may provide a historical perspective of the nature and accuracy of the claims submitted by the contractor and how they were settled. Potential sources for the information include the contracting activityâ€™s office of legal counsel, other contracting activities, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.</p>
