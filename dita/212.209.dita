that the information obtained through market research pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this section, is insufficient to determine the
reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider
information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid
by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial
items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price
reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer
is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference
for comparison. In assessing whether the prices previously paid
remain a valid reference for comparison, the contracting officer
shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the
time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the
quantities purchased <xref href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section2306a&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim"

         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed
to preclude the contracting officer from requiring the contractor
to supply information that is sufficient to determine the reasonableness
of price, regardless of whether or not the contractor was required to
provide such information in connection with any earlier procurement.
If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information
submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price,
the contracting officer may request other relevant information regarding
the basis for price or cost, including uncertified cost data such
as labor costs, material costs, and other direct and indirect costs.</p>
