         <p>Contracting officers considering the purchase of an item from a foreign source may encounter a request for the signing of a certificate to indicate that the Armed Forces of the United States is the end user of the item, and that the U.S. Government will not transfer the item to third parties without authorization from the Government of the country selling the item.  When encountering this situation, refer to DoD Directive 2040.3, End Use Certificates, for guidance.</p>
