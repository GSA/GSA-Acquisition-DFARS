         <p outputclass="List2">(3)  Provide a copy of the notification to the Contracting Officer.</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b)  After receipt of a notification submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the DoD Program Manager will—</p>

         <p outputclass="List1">(d)  Following a security assessment of the Contractor’s facility, DoD officials will notify the Contractor as to—</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1)  Whether the Contractor’s facility has any vulnerabilities where potentially declarable activities under the U.S.-IAEA AP are taking place;</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2)  Whether additional security measures are needed; and</p>

         <p outputclass="List1">(f)  If DoD does not apply a national security exclusion, the Contractor shall apply managed access to prevent disclosure of program activities, locations, or information in the U.S. declaration.</p>
