should include in a solicitation both the progress payments and
performance-based payments provisions and clauses prescribed in
this part, when considering both types of payment methods. Only

payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-based
payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events,
completion criteria and event values along with the projected monthly
expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance
events such that the performance-based payments are not expected
to result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor
investment in the contract.</p>

the Government will evaluate and negotiate the details of the performance-based

contracts that already use performance-based payments financing,
the basis for negotiation must include performance-based payments.

the price for the modification;</p>
