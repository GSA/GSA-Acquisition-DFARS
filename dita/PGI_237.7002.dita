      <body>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Determine and define the geographical area to be covered by the contract using the following general guidelines:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) Use political boundaries, streets, or other features as demarcation lines.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) The size should be roughly equivalent to the contiguous metropolitan or municipal area enlarged to include the activities served.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) If the area of performance best suited to the needs of a particular contract is not large enough to include a carrier terminal commonly used by people within the area, the contract area of performance shall specifically state that it includes the terminal as a pickup or delivery point.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) In addition to normal contract distribution, send three copies of each contract to each activity authorized to use the contract, and two copies to each of the following:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) HQDA (TAPC-PEC-D), Alexandria, VA 22331.</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) Commander, Naval Medical Command, Department of the Navy (MED 3141), 23rd and E Streets NW, Washington, DC 20372. </p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) Headquarters, AFMPC-MPCCM.</p>
