         <p class="p List3">(i)  Carrier demurrage/detention is a charge made against a consignor (shipper) or consignee (receiver) for the extended use of carrier-furnished equipment when delays attributable to the consignor or consignee occur.  Carrier demurrage/detention rules usually allow a period of free time for loading, unloading, or holding equipment.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Carrier-published demurrage/detention rules and charges are not uniform from one carrier to another.  Contracting officers should specifically address them in the contract.  While demurrage/detention rules are published in individual carrier tariffs or agency tenders, Contracting Officers may negotiate contract-specific demurrage/detention rules and charges independent of any existing tariffs or tenders.</p>
