         <p class="p">The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) provides item risk, price risk, and supplier risk assessment on end products and price risk and supplier risk assessment on services. SPRS provides item and price risk for end products using the material identifiers listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v). SPRS also provides a supplier risk score for the contractor that provided the product or services. The contracting officer may consider item risk, price risk, and supplier risk assessments to determine the performance risk of the offeror or product and to assess the risk of ongoing contractor performance.</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (a) <em class="ph i">Item risk.</em>

         <p class="p List2"> (2) <em class="ph i">Presolicitation.</em> For items identified as high risk in SPRS or by the requiring activity in purchase requests, the contracting officer shall mitigate this risk by including a clause that addresses first article approval or certificate of conformance in the solicitation or by applying other risk mitigation strategies.</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (b) <em class="ph i">Price risk.</em> SPRS provides the contracting officer warning of possible over- or under-payment risks based on historical purchase data.</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (c) <em class="ph i">Supplier risk.</em> SPRS provides the contracting officer a score for the assessment of the contractor’s performance. The supplier risk score includes data associated with the contractor’s quality and delivery data.</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (d) <em class="ph i">Evaluation of quotations or offers for supplies. </em>During the evaluation of the offers received for supplies or services that contain supplies, the contracting officer shall consider the risk assessments available in SPRS.</p>
