the Government fiscal year.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Audit and other organizations</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The contract auditor is responsible
for assisting the CMS by performing the portion of cost monitoring
plan and related analyses that requires access to the contractor's
financial and accounting records supporting the cost or pricing
data. (This does not preclude the program manager, contracting officer,
ACO, CMS, or other representatives from reviewing contractor records
and data necessary to the performance of their duties.)</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Audit organizations, program offices,

         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS_PGI_PGI_242.302Monitoring__i1347726">(d) <em class="ph i">Annual cost monitoring
plan</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Description</em>.</p>
         <p class="p" id="DFARS_PGI_PGI_242.302Monitoring__i1347730">The annual cost monitoring plan is a strategy
for monitoring, reviewing, negotiating, and approving contractor’s
direct and indirect rates, business systems, corrective actions
to deficient processes, and cost controls by coordinating the capabilities
of the CAO, DCAA, and other Government representatives in an effort
to reduce unreasonable, erroneous, or improper costs to Government
contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Contents of the plan</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The plan should—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Provide coverage for each significant
activity of the contractor over a period of five to ten years;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Provide coverage for contractor future
years dependent on the period of forward pricing years the contractor proposes
and the expected length of executed Government programs;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Be updated to reflect changed conditions
as the year progresses; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Be consistent with the approved schedule,
and any deviations should be explained in the final cost monitoring report.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The plan must identify the organizations
having the primary responsibility for performing the reviews.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The plan should include reviews required
by the ACO and DFARS. Reviews will be performed by the assigned organization
during the coordination phase of the cost monitoring plan, except
when DFARS makes a specific organizational assignment. For example,
Subpart <a class="xref 244.301 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="244.301.html#DFARS_244.301">244.301</a> makes the ACO
responsible for leading contractor purchasing system reviews and 
               <a class="xref 215.407-5 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_215.407-5.html#DFARS_PGI_PGI_215.407-5">215.407-5</a>
            -70(c)(3)
makes the DCAA auditor responsible for leading estimating system
reviews on behalf of the ACO.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Selecting the activities</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The CAO selects the activities for
the cost monitoring plan. DCAA will complete its annual audit plan
independently and communicate the approved audit plan to ensure
the most effective monitoring approach. To ensure all Government
interests are considered in the selection, the CMS should invite
CAO, DCAA, and other interested Government representatives to a
meeting before the beginning of each Government fiscal year to identify
and prioritize the areas to be reviewed during the coming year,
to ensure a fully communicated Government cost monitoring plan.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The selection team should consider
the following data and assign primary responsibility in the selection
process—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Contractor forecasts for the coming
years supporting direct and indirect costs by functional centers
of its cost control system and the results of the latest survey
performed of such systems;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Organizational charts for the contractor's
entire operation;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Outline of the contractor's accounting
system showing the flow of costs by function;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Determination of Government participation
in the dollars attributable to the operations and cost accounts
under consideration;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) List of recent reviews and audits performed
by CAO, DCAA, and other Government representatives; list should show
outstanding weakness and deficiencies in the contractor's operations
that will be considered for follow-up reviews or audits;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Evidence of contractor under or over
staffing;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Significant departures from established
contractor productivity standards;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) Major financial variances from forecasts
in prior years;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(I) Evidences of idle or under-used capacity;</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_PGI_242.302Monitoring__i1347758">(J) Any visits or audit
plans scheduled by other Government organizations and identified
to the CMS; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(K) Any other significant information or
business changes which could have an adverse effect or cause a significant change
to on the contractor’s management of contract costs.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Prioritizing the plan</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The CMS should prioritize the plan
to review contractor activity by considering—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The extent of competition in awarded
contracts;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The contractor's operating methods;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The nature of the work;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Acquisition cycle stage;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Business and industry practices;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Types of contracts involved;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Degree of technical and financial risk;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) Previously reported findings and deficiencies;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(I) Ratio of Government/commercial work;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(J) Significant changes in the level (dollars)
of the contractor’s work and backlog; and</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_PGI_242.302Monitoring__i1347772">(K) The extent performance
efficiencies have been previously demonstrated.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Plan approval and submission</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The local DCAA office will provide
an approved annual audit plan to the ACO within 30 days after the
first day of each fiscal year.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The CMS will submit an adequate cost
monitoring plan to the head of the local CAO within 45 days after
the first day of each fiscal year.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The head of the local CAO, or designee,
will approve the annual cost monitoring plan within 15 days of an
adequate submission. The head of the local CAO will ensure that
adequate coordination of the cost monitoring plan was performed
with the DCAA and other responsible Government representatives.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Reviews and analysis</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Perform functional reviews and audits
as scheduled in accordance with the cost monitoring plan.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Hold interim meetings with the contractor
as necessary to clarify information. Hold an exit conference at
the conclusion of reviews.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Prepare reports at the conclusion
of reviews. The ACO will determine whether a Government review or
audit report will be provided to a contractor based on specific
regulatory requirements or the impact to pending negotiations or litigation.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Prepare periodic reports on the results
of the CMS analysis and monitoring of the contractors rates and
factors, which should address the causes for significant deviations
from historical and negotiated forward pricing rates and factors.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Annual cost monitoring report</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Description</em>.</p>
         <p class="p">The annual cost monitoring report is a culmination of the Government
activities performed during the fiscal year in an effort to conduct
and maintain a formal monitoring program of contractor policies,
procedures, and practices for controlling costs charged to Government
contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Contents of the report</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The report should—</p>
