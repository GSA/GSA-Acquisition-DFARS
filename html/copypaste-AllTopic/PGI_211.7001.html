         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS-PGI_PGI_211.7001__yHjvLg">(a) Agencies may use a combined
numbering series for MIPRs and internal purchase requests, following
the rules at <a class="xref 253.208-1 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_253.208-1.html#DFARS-PGI_PGI_253.208-1">PGI 253.208-1</a> (c)(1)
for both. If using a separate numbering sequence for internal purchase
requests, procedures shall be in place to ensure that the same number
cannot be assigned to both a MIPR and an internal purchase request.
Use of a purely internal tracking number in addition to the purchase
request number is authorized and supported by the data standards. Number
the purchase request by using—</p>
         <p class="p List2" id="DFARS-PGI_PGI_211.7001__KmuLSH">(1) The requiring activity’s
Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), as described
in DLM 4000.25 Volume 6, Chapter 2. DODAACs may be verified at https://www.transactionservices.dla.mil/daasinq.</p>

the original request being assigned zero and subsequent revisions
or amendments being numbered consecutively.</p>
         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS-PGI_PGI_211.7001__JApFSe">(b) Prior to taking action
on a purchase request, contracting officers shall ensure that the
requiring activity has prepared the purchase requests in uniform
contract format (see FAR 14.201-1 and 15.204), except for procurement
of construction (see part 36), which should follow the current edition
of the Construction Specifications Institute format. Purchase requests shall
include all supporting documentation required by local contract
procedures.</p>

requests will, at a minimum, identify the following elements of
the funding source: Department Code (e.g. 21 Army), Main Account
(e.g. 1804, Operation and Maintenance, Navy), Subaccount (where
applicable), and Fiscal Year. Lists of these codes are published
in Supplement 1 to Volume I of the <em class="ph i">Treasury Financial Manual,
Federal Account Symbols and Titles</em>, generally referred to as <a class="xref" href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/fastbook/index.html" target="_blank">The FAST Book</a>

         <p class="p List2" id="DFARS-PGI_PGI_211.7001__ikESfe">(3) Agencies shall have sufficient
procedures in place to enable traceability of line items identified
in the purchase request to those in the resulting contract. In developing
such procedures, agencies shall ensure that provisions are made
for circumstances in which the deliverables may be more completely
defined during the process of soliciting offers and making an award.</p>
