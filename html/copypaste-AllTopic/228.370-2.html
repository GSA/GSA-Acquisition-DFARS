         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Preaward survey</em>. Before awarding
                        any contract using the clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, the
                        contracting officer should obtain a preaward survey of the offeror’s
                        proposed aircraft flight and ground operations facility. If the offeror
                        proposed subcontracting any aircraft work, the preaward survey should
                        include a review of the subcontractor’s facility. For acquisitions falling
                        under the exceptions at 228.371(b)(1)(iii), (iv), and (vi), the contracting
                        officer shall review the documentation the offeror submitted with the
                        proposal in response to the DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List,
                        to ensure the offeror’s commercial insurance provides the appropriate
                        coverage required by the clause at 252.228-7001.</p>

                        FMS customer has explicitly refused assumption of risk of loss. If the FMS
                        customer has accepted the standard Letter of Offer and Acceptance Standard

                        aircraft flying public aircraft operations operate under airworthiness

                        certificate in the exception in this paragraph (d) underlies the military
                        service certificate.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Insurance</em>. The clause at 252.228-7001, Ground
                        and Flight Risk, is intended to reduce acquisition costs by eliminating the
                        costs of commercial insurance premiums. This clause also is intended to
                        encourage the contractor to perform safe and effective operations through
                        inclusion of a contractor’s share of loss (i.e., a deductible).
                        Additionally, the clause requires compliance with the combined
                        regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations”
                        (Air Force Instruction 10-220, Army Regulation 95-20, Naval Air Systems
                        Command (NAVAIR) Instruction 3710.1 (Series), Coast Guard Instruction
                        M13020.3 (Series), and Defense Contract Management Agency Instruction 8210-1
                        (Series)), which provides procedures to mitigate the risk of loss to the
                        Government. For this reason, paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the clause at
                        252.228-7001 specifies that insurance premium costs are unallowable. In
                        addition, paragraph (d)(4) of the clause provides that the Government’s
                        assumption of risk does not apply where the loss or damage is covered by
                        available insurance.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1) Whenever damage to Government aircraft
                        is reported, each incident should be evaluated on its own merits. When the
                        cost of repair exceeds the contractor’s share of loss provisions, the
                        contracting officer shall make a liability determination in accordance with
                        paragraph (g) of this section.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Contracting officers
                        should consult with the requiring activity and the assigned contract

         <p class="p List2">(1) When making a liability determination,
                        the contracting officer should seek input from the GFR and legal counsel, as

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the crew members have

                        252.228-7001, including finding the covered aircraft are exposed to
                        unreasonable conditions, the contracting officer shall issue a preliminary

                        contractor and shall require the contractor to comply with contract

         <p class="p List3">(ii) The preliminary

                        the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground

                        has reason to believe that the contractor has been reimbursed or otherwise
                        compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of covered
                        aircraft and has also been compensated by the Government, then the
                        contracting officer shall demand an equitable reimbursement. If the
                        contracting officer requests that the contractor provide reasonable
                        assistance in obtaining recovery, such effort shall be an allowable expense
                        of the contractor.</p>
