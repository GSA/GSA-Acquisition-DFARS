         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions</em>. As used in this section—</p>
         <p class="p">“Covered contract” means a DoD prime contract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price contract without cost incentives. The term also includes a subcontract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime contract.</p>
         <p class="p">“Covered segment” means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development (IR&amp;D) costs and bid and proposal (B&amp;P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole. A product division of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&amp;D costs and B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
         <p class="p">“Major contractor” means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11 million in IR&amp;D costs and B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&amp;D and B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
