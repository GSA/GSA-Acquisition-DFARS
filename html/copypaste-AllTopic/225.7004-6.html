         <p class="p List3"> (i) Sufficient domestic suppliers are not available to meet DoD requirements on a timely basis; and</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (ii) The acquisition is necessary to acquire capability for national security purposes.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (2) Document the waiver in a written determination and findings containing—</p>

L. 116-283)).</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (c) Waiver of restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 4864(a).

         <p class="p List2"> (1)(i) USD(A&amp;S), without power of delegation, may waive a restriction for a particular item for a particular foreign country upon determination that—</p>
         <p class="p List4"> (A) U.S. producers of the item would not be jeopardized by competition from a foreign country, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country; or</p>
         <p class="p List4"> (B) Application of the restriction would impede cooperative programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, or would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items under a memorandum of understanding providing for reciprocal procurement of defense items under <a class="xref 225.872 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="225.872.html#DFARS_225.872">225.872</a>, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (ii) A notice of the determination to exercise the waiver authority shall be published in the Federal Register and submitted to the congressional defense committees at least 15 days before the effective date of the waiver.</p>

         <p class="p List2"> (2) The head of the contracting activity may waive a restriction on a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings that any of the following applies:</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (i) The restriction would cause unreasonable delays.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (ii) Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the national technology and industrial base are not available.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (iii) Application of the restriction would result in the existence of only one source for the item in the national technology and industrial base.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (iv) Application of the restriction is not in the national security interests of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (v) Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. company.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (3) A restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs.
