         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS_PGI_218.271__CsVbJM">(a) Use of electronic
business (e-business) acquisition tools greatly enhances the efficacy
of the contracting process in a contingency business environment
(CBE). The CBE involves specific tools, policies, roles and responsibilities,
and processes necessary to streamline delivery of goods and services
to the end user and to implement an e-business program with the capabilities
necessary to support an end-to-end electronic acquisition process
in order to quickly obtain goods and services for the warfighter
in an operational area. For information and procedures to effectively
utilize CBE e-business tools, and additional policy references supporting
use of the e-business tools, see the DoD CBE Guidebook at
               <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cc/docs/resources/CBE_Guidebook.docx" target="_blank">https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cc/docs/resources/CBE_Guidebook.docx</a>

         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS_PGI_218.271__SJktYB">(b) Use of the following
CBE e-business tools is mandatory when supporting a contingency
or humanitarian or peacekeeping operation as defined in FAR 2.101:</p>
         <p class="p List2" id="DFARS_PGI_218.271__BwFiSh">(1) The 3in1 Tool. The 3in1
Tool automates the field order, receipt, and purchase processes
previously executed manually using the paper Standard Form (SF)
44. The 3in1 handheld device records and transmits cash and carry
type purchases and payment data to the prime database for remote
reconciliation and review, when conducting on-the-spot, over-the-counter
field purchases where use of the Government Purchase Card is appropriate,
but not feasible. The 3in1 database may be accessed on the Joint
Contingency Contracting Systems (JCCS) website at https://www.jccs.gov/olvr/.</p>
         <p class="p List2" id="DFARS_PGI_218.271__SuCtgq">(2) The Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSA) Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS). AGATRS is an automated tool that tracks and provides visibility into worldwide ACSAs that may satisfy a requirement through support from the host nation or other nations supporting the contingency. ACSA transactions that are used in support of contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operations are required to be documented and tracked in AGATRS as required by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 2120.01D, Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreements (https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/2120_01.pdf?ver=CHcrQXsNoR43vDcR5Y80sg%3d%3d). AGATRS is accessible on the JCCS website at https://www.jccs.gov/olvr.</p>
         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS_PGI_218.271__hHXEiJ">(c) No other electronic tools
may be used to fulfill the same capabilities as 3in1 and AGATRS.</p>
         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS_PGI_218.271__XtPHlH">(d) See PGI <a class="xref 225.370 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_225.370.html#DFARS_PGI_225.370">225.370</a> (a)(ii) regarding use of the Theater Business Clearance
CBE e-business tool.</p>
