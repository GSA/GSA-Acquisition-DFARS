a subcontractor does not have summary level scores of a current
NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment (i.e., not more than 3 years old
unless a lesser time is specified in the solicitation) posted in
SPRS, the subcontractor may conduct and submit a Basic Assessment,
in accordance with the NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology,
