         <p class="p List2">(2) Assist in the identification and acquisition of necessary data rights and technical data, and the review of restrictive legends on technical data, during system/equipment development and production to allow, when feasible, breakout of parts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Designate a program manager to serve as the central focal point, communicate breakout policy, ensure cost-effectiveness of screening actions and breakout program, provide assistance in implementing breakout screening, monitor ongoing breakout efforts and achievements, and provide surveillance over implementation of the breakout program. The program manager shall report only to the Commander, or deputy, of the activity with breakout screening responsibility.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Ensure that actions to remove impediments to breakout are continued as long as it is cost-effective, or until no further breakout improvements can be made.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Invite the activity's small business specialist and the resident small business administration's procurement center representative, if any, to participate in all acquisition method coding conferences at Government and contractor locations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Ensure timely engineering and technical support to other breakout activities regardless of location.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) In the case of parts where contracting or inventory management responsibility has been transferred, support shall include—</p>

         <p class="p List4">(B) Assignment of an AMC/AMSC when requested by the receiving activity to parts transferred without such codes. The requesting activity may recommend an AMC/AMSC; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Full support of the receiving activities' breakout effort by providing timely engineering support in revising existing AMC/AMSCs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) In all cases, support shall include, but not be limited to, furnishing all necessary technical data and other information (such as code suspense date and procurement history) to permit acquisition in accordance with the assigned AMC/AMSC (see 1-105(d)(6)).</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1) Consider the AMC/AMSC when developing the method of contracting, the list of sources to be solicited, the type of contract, etc.; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Provide information that is inconsistent with the assigned AMC/AMSC (e.g., availability of technical data or possible sources) to the activity responsible for code assignment with a request for timely evaluation of the additional information. An urgent immediate buy need not be delayed if an evaluation of the additional information cannot be completed in time to meet the required delivery date.</p>
