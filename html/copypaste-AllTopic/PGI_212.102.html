         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)The contracting officer making
the determination shall document the market research and rationale
supporting a conclusion that the item is or is not commercial and include
it in the contract file.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)Particular care must be taken
when documenting determinations involving “modifications of a type
customarily available in the marketplace,” and items only “offered
for sale, lease, or license to the general public” but not yet actually
sold, leased, or licensed. In these situations, the documentation
must clearly detail the particulars of the modifications and sales
offers. When such items lack sufficient market pricing information, additional
diligence must be given to determinations that prices are fair and
reasonable as required by FAR subpart 15.4.</p>
         <p class="p List6">

U.S.C. 2380</a>(b)(2), within 30 days of contract award, the
contracting officer making the determination shall upload the signed
commercial item determination or
the decision that the item does not meet the commercial item definition
at FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">2.101</a>
             to
the DoD Commercial Item Database at <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil" target="_blank">https://piee.eb.mil</a>. The only documentation that
is required to be uploaded to the database is the commercial item
determination or the decision that the item is not commercial. Contracting
officers shall avoid uploading any data marked as proprietary or
controlled unclassified information to the Commercial Item Database.

         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Prior commercial item determination</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)
If a prior DoD commercial item determination for the same item is
made by a military department, defense agency, or another component
of DoD, contracting officers may presume that the prior commercial
item determination shall serve as a determination for subsequent
procurements of such item, unless the process is followed to overturn
the prior determination (see DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="212.102.html#DFARS-212.102">212.102</a>(a)(ii)(B)). If there is no prior commercial
item determination, see PGI 212.102(a)(ii)(B).</p>
         <p class="p List4">
            (B)
If the DoD Commercial Item Database contains a prior decision that
an item does not meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">2.101</a>,
the contracting officer may use the prior decision to serve as the
decision for subsequent procurements of the same item. To promote
consistent acquisition procedures across DoD, contracting officers
should consult contracting activities that regularly procure the
item to understand the basis for determining that the item does
not meet the commercial item definition at FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">2.101</a>.
If there is no prior commercial item determination or prior decision
that an item does not meet the definition of a commercial item at
FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">2.101</a>,
