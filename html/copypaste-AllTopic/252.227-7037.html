If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer cannot determine the basis of the asserted restriction, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any asserted restriction on technical data delivered,to be delivered, or otherwise provided to the Government under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that continued adherence to the asserted restriction would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer will follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>

The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, will formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule will afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.</p>

The Contracting Officer will issue this final decision within 60 days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The Contracting Officer will provide notification of any longer period for issuance of a final decision within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the asserted restriction is not justified, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract. To sustain the challenge for commercial products or commercial services, the Contracting Officer will provide information demonstrating that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision will be issued within 60 days after receipt of the Contractor’s or subcontractor’s response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the asserted restriction for a period of 90 days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer’s final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.

If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the 90-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markingsthat are based on the asserted restrictions, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the asserted restriction where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims is provided to the Contracting Officer within 90 days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive marking that is based on the asserted restriction, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within 1 year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims , the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the asserted restrictions where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>

During the period within 6 years of final payment on a contract or within 6 years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure, or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—</p>
