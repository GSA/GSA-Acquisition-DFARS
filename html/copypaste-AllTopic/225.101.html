         <p class="p List1">(a) For DoD, the following two-part
test determines whether a manufactured end product is a domestic
end product:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The end product is manufactured in
the United States; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) (A) Except
               for an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a
               combination of both, the cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components
            exceeds 55 percent of the cost of all its
            components. This test is applied to end products only and not to individual
            components.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) For an end product that consists
            wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of iron and
            steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country must constitute less
            than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product. The cost of
            iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country includes but is
            not limited to the cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire,
            plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States or a
            qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith
            estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components not produced in the United States
            or a qualifying country, excluding commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)
            fasteners. The domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for
            acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Additional exceptions that allow the
purchase of foreign end products are listed at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="225.103.html#DFARS_225.103">225.103</a>.</p>
