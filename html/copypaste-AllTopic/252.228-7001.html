New production articles become aircraft at a stage of manufacture or production when a wing, portion of a wing, or engine is attached to a fuselage. Blended wing/lifting bodies become aircraft at a stage of manufacture or production when the center portion and a lifting surface become attached.</p>
         <p class="p">“Contractor’s managerial personnel” means the Contractor’s directors, officers, managers, superintendents, or equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of—</p>

         <p class="p List2"> (3) New production aircraft when wholly outside of buildings on the Contractor’s premises or other places described in the Schedule (e.g., hush houses, run stations, and paint facilities); and</p>

         </p>
         <p class="p List2"> (1) The Contractor’s liability to the Government for damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft is limited to the Contractor’s share of loss as defined at paragraph (h) of this clause, except when one of the exclusions at paragraph (d) applies.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the crewmembers have not been approved in advance and writing by the GFR, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations”;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance on public streets, highways, or waterways, unless the transportation is limited to the vicinity of the Contractor’s premises, and incidental to work performed under the contract as described in the Schedule;</p>

               <em class="ph i">Revoking the Government’s assumption of risk</em>
            .</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Contracting Officer, when finding that the Contractor’s managerial personnel have failed to comply with paragraph (b) of this clause, will issue a preliminary notice of revocation requiring the Contractor to comply with contract requirements within a timeframe specified by the Contracting Officer. In determining exposure to unreasonable conditions, the Contracting Officer will consider factors including, but not limited to, the following:  lack of adequate hangar fire suppression or firefighting vehicles, failure to provide adequate procedures to the GFR, or systemic failure to comply with approved procedures.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (2) Upon receipt of the preliminary notice of revocation, the Contractor shall promptly correct the noncompliance or cited conditions, regardless of whether there is agreement that the conditions are unreasonable.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (3) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor failed to correct the cited noncompliance or conditions within the specified timeframe, the Contracting Officer will issue a notice of revocation of the Government’s assumption of risk for any covered aircraft.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (4) If the Contracting Officer issues a notice of revocation pursuant to the terms of this clause—</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (i) The Contractor shall thereafter assume the entire risk for damage, loss, or destruction of the previously covered aircraft;</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (ii) Any costs incurred by the Contractor (including the costs of the Contractor’s self-insurance, insurance premiums paid to insure the Contractor’s assumption of risk, deductibles associated with such purchased insurance, etc.) to mitigate its risk are unallowable costs; and</p>

         <p class="p List2"> (5) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer when the noncompliance or cited conditions have been corrected. Within 3 days of receipt of the Contractor’s notice of correction, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor whether the Government will resume risk of loss. The Contracting Officer will determine that the noncompliance or cited conditions have been corrected prior to resuming assumption of risk.</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (6) The notice of revocation does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions of this clause, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations.” </p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Any disputes regarding the Contracting Officer’s notice of revocation shall be subject to FAR clause <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.233-1" target="_blank">52.233-1</a>, Disputes.</p>
