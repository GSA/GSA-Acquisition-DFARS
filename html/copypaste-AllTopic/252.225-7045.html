            the contractor, constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used
            in such construction material (produced in the United States means that all
            manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States,
            except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives). The cost of
            iron and steel not produced in the United States includes but is not limited to the cost
            of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet),
            castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States, utilized in the manufacture of
            the construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel
            components not produced in the United States, excluding COTS fasteners. Iron or steel
            components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the construction material
            contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such construction
            material is calculated in accordance with the definition of “cost of components” in this
            clause.</p>
         <p class="p">“Free Trade Agreement country construction material” means a construction material that—</p>

            products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings
            utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith estimate of the cost of iron
            or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. </p>
         <p class="p">“Steel” means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent
            iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements. </p>

               manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States,
               except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives). The cost of
               iron and steel not produced in the United States includes but is not limited to the
               cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or
               sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States, utilized in the
               manufacture of the construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of all
               iron or steel components not produced in the United States, excluding COTS fasteners.
               Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the
               construction material contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials
               used in such construction material is calculated in accordance with the definition of
               “cost of components” in this clause.</p>

The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material.</p>
            <p class="p"> “Cost of components” means—</p>
            <p class="p List2"> (1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or</p>

Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. Components of unknown origin are treated as foreign; or</p>
            <p class="p List4"> (B) The construction material is a COTS item; or</p>
            <p class="p List2"> (2) For construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, a construction material manufactured in the United States if the cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States (excluding fasteners) as estimated in good faith by the contractor, constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in such construction material (produced in the United States means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives). The cost of iron and steel not produced in the United States includes but is not limited to the cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States, utilized in the manufacture of the construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of iron or steel components not produced in the United States, excluding COTS fasteners. Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the construction material contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such construction material is calculated in accordance with the definition of “cost of components” in this clause.</p>
