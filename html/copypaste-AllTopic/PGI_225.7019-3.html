      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The following are factors
to take into consideration for granting a waiver:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The energy supply system is physically
incapable of segregating Russian Federation energy from non-Russian
Federation energy.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The installation can only obtain the
necessary energy from its current supplier without the unaffordable
expense of constructing new supply lines.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The price of requiring the supplier
to segregate the energy is unaffordable and would result in the
installation being unable to perform its mission within its budget
authority.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Consideration, by the requiring activity,
of installation energy and security resilience has been taken into
account (e.g., on-site sources of energy and fuel resupply would
allow the installation to continue to perform its mission even with disruption
of Russian Federation-sourced energy, the installation has addressed
energy resilience and security risks and vulnerabilities, etc.).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The head of the contracting activity shall submit to the congressional defense committees a notice of the waiver with a copy to DPCAP, Contract Policy, via email at <a class="xref" href="mailto:osd.pentagon.ousd-a-s.mbx.dpc-cp@mail.mil" target="_blank">osd.pentagon.ousd-a-s.mbx.dpc-cp@mail.mil</a>, at least 14 days before the award of an energy contract on the basis of an approved waiver. The notification shall include a copy of the waiver. The contracting officer shall include a copy of the approved waiver in the contract file.</p>
