            (i)(A) If the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the contractor considers that no U.S.-flag vessels are available, the contracting officer shall review that notification. If the contracting officer agrees with the contractor’s request, then the contracting officer shall request a nonavailability waiver, in determination and findings format, using details received from the contractor in accordance with paragraph (d) of the clause at DFARS 252.247-7023, from—</p>

Variances from that approved waiver, including changing the foreign-flag vessel approved for use, may require a new request and approval from the cognizant waiver approval authority.
