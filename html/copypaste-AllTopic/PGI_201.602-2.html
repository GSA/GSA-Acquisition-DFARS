         <p class="p" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__CcalzQ">Contracting officers shall inform all
individuals performing on their behalf of their delegated roles
and responsibilities, and the relationships among the parties.</p>
         <p class="p List1" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__QJUeOy">(d)(i) When designating Department
of State personnel as a contracting officer’s representative (COR
for contracts executed by DoD in support of Department of State
in Iraq), follow the procedures in the Director, Defense Procurement
and Acquisition Policy memorandum dated July 11, 2011, Contracting
Officer’s Representative Designation—Iraq.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__CDeFkC">(ii) DoD COR certification
standards define minimum COR competencies, experience, and training
requirements according to the nature and complexity of the requirement
and contract performance risk. These COR certification standards
should be considered when developing service requirements, soliciting
proposals, and performing surveillance during contract performance.
The DoD standards and policy are provided in DoD Instruction 5000.72, DoD
Standard for Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) Certification.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__xUijbo">(iii) Guidance on the appointment
and duties of CORs is provided in the DoD COR Guidebook.
         </p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__iUyIlD">(iv) DoD agencies and components
shall use the Joint
Appointment Module (JAM), within in the Procurement Integrated Enterprise
Environment (PIEE), to electronically track COR nominations,
appointments, terminations, and training certifications for contracts assigned a COR.
Components shall use the Surveillance and Performance Monitoring
(SPM) Module, located in the PIEE, for all other contract surveillance
actions. Further guidance on the use of JAM and SPM Module is available
at https://wawf.eb.mil https://piee.eb.mil/piee-landing/.
         </p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__orOLTI">(v) A COR assists in the
technical monitoring or administration of a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__dvoErz">(A) Unless an exemption at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="201.602-2.html#DFARS_201.602-2">201.602-2</a>(d)(v)(A) or
(B) applies, 
            contracting
officers shall designate a COR for all service contracts, and supply contracts
with cost-reimbursable line items including both firm-fixed-price
and other than firm-fixed-price contracts, awarded by a DoD component
or by any other Federal agency on behalf of DoD within 3 business days of contract
award. The surveillance activities performed by CORs should
be tailored to the dollar value/complexity of the specific contract
for which they are designated. For geographically dispersed large
contracts with multiple task orders, contracting officers should
consider appointing multiple or alternate CORs to assist with surveillance
duties. These CORs should have specific duties based on criteria,
such as geographic region or distinct task areas, to avoid conflicting
or duplicative direction. Contracting officers may exempt service
contracts from this requirement when the following three conditions
are met:</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__VqVsUq">(<em class="ph i" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__dIfSjh">1</em>)
The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures;</p>
         <p class="p List6" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__vyHoiN">(<em class="ph i" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__xvsYeV">2</em>)
The requirement is not complex; and</p>
         <p class="p List6" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__NhogIS">(<em class="ph i" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__MeqwjH">3</em>)
The contracting officer documents the file, in writing, with the
specific reasons why the appointment of a COR is unnecessary.</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__JsvZQN">(B) For cost reimbursement
contracts that are not service contracts, contracting officers shall
either retain or delegate surveillance activities to a COR or DCMA.</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__GkOruc">(C) The contracting officer
shall ensure the
written designation required by FAR 1.602-2(d)(7) is maintained in JAM or the SPM Module.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__huNpxh">(vi) A COR shall maintain
an electronic COR
Surveillance file in the SPM Module for each contract
assigned. This file must include, at a
minimum—</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__BSvHRm">(A) A copy of the contracting
officer's letter of designation and other documentation describing
the COR's duties and responsibilities; and</p>
         <p class="p List4" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__bAywlN">(B) Documentation of actions
taken in accordance with the delegation of authority.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__zbSJDW">(vii) Contracting officers,
as well as the requiring activities (or the COR’s supervisor), shall,
at a minimum, annually review
the COR’s files for accuracy and completeness. The results of the
contracting officer’s review shall be documented in the SPM Module.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_201.602-2__GqSlme">(viii) Prior to contract
closeout, the COR will ensure the
COR Surveillance files for
the assigned contract are complete and
available to the contracting officer .</p>
