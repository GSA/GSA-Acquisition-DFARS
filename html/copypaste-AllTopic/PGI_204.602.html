The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) website at https://www.fpds.gov
provides useful documents and on-line training to assist with FPDS
data entry. Key manuals can be found at the top of the website homepage
under the “Training” and “Worksite” drop-down links to include:</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_204.602__EaCBLn">(i) <em class="ph i">FPDS Data Element Dictionary</em>. The data dictionary outlines relevant information for each data field. The Data Dictionary identifies whether a data field is “Required,” “Optional,” “Propagates from the base action,” “Not Applicable,” or “System Generated,” for each type of data entry screen (Awards, Indefinite-Delivery Vehicles, and Transactions/Modifications). It also identifies the source of data entry (e.g., Contracting Officer,(SAM), FPDS); the format of the field; and whether the field input is derived from entries in other fields. At the back of the Data Dictionary is a useful summary.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_204.602__uHoHLA">(ii) <em class="ph i">FPDS Data Validations</em>.
This document identifies all the validation rules that are applied
to data entry. The majority of the rules apply Governmentwide. DoD
specific validation rules appear at “5.5.1 DoD Specific Validations.”</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_PGI_204.602__sBgNng">(iii) <em class="ph i">FPDS Users Manual</em>.
This manual provides guidance on the various types of data entry
screens and addresses whether a particular field is: “[R]” – requires
contracting officer/buyer entry; “[A]” – pre-populated by FPDS or
a contract writing system, if using machine-to-machine process;
or “[C]” – calculated by FPDS for each type of data entry screen.
However, the nature of the field is determined based on Governmentwide
requirements. To determine DoD-specific requirements, refer to J3
“DoD Use Case Summary” in the FPDS Data Element Dictionary. The
FPDS User Manual is not a policy document; it is intended only for
general guidance. Refer to this PGI section for specific FPDS reporting
entries.</p>
