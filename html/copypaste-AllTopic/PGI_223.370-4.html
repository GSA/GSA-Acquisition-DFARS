         <p class="p List3">(i) Contract administration office responsibility.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The contract administration office is responsible for verifying that the safety requirements of the clause at DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.223-7002.html#DFARS_252.223-7002">252.223-7002</a>, Safety Precautions for Ammunition and Explosives, are being implemented in a manner that will reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, or eliminate the probability of a mishap occurring.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The clause at DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.223-7002.html#DFARS_252.223-7002">252.223-7002</a>, Safety Precautions for Ammunition and Explosives, requires compliance with DoD 4145.26-M, Contractors’ Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives. This manual requires the contractor to submit to the administrative contracting officer (ACO) any postaward requests for a waiver of the contract safety standards, a site plan modification, or a construction review. The ACO shall review any request and make recommendations to the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall make a decision after considering recommendations of the ACO and safety personnel responsible for ammunition and explosive safety.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) If the request arrives at the contracting office without evidence that the ACO has seen it, immediately send it to the ACO for review and recommendations.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) When the contracting officer has made a determination approving or disapproving the contractor's request, send the determination to the ACO for transmission to the contractor.</p>

The contracting officer should coordinate with the safety personnel and request supporting contract administration in accordance with FAR 42.202(e). If the contracting officer believes the nature of the subcontract work poses a potential danger to Government property, Government personnel, production capability, or contract completion, request supporting contract administration.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) If the preaward safety survey identified areas in which a subcontractor was not complying with the manual, and the subcontractor was supposed to correct the deficiencies before start-up, the contracting officer shall require a preoperations survey to verify that the corrections were made.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) When postaward safety reviews by the Government uncover any safety deficiencies in the subcontractor's operation, the review team shall inform the ACO cognizant of the subcontractor, who shall immediately notify the ACO cognizant of the prime contractor. The ACO cognizant of the prime shall inform the prime contractor of deficiencies requiring correction. The notifications shall be made by the most expeditious means appropriate to the circumstance. If a critical safety deficiency poses an imminent danger, the ACO cognizant of the prime shall make the notifications by the most expeditious means available.</p>
