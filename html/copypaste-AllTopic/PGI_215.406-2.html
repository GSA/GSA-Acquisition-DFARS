         <p class="p List1">(c)(i) Prior to the start of negotiations,
contracting officers should notify offerors and contractors that—</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (A) A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing
Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2, shall be submitted as soon
as practicable after agreement on price (preferably within 5 days
after price agreement), but before contract award or execution of
a modification (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(B) A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing
Data that deviates from the language specified in FAR 15.406-2,
or has been amended to include certification of data submitted after
the date of price agreement, will not be accepted.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(ii) If any data is submitted after the
date of price agreement, contracting officers shall—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(A) Notify offerors in writing that such
data will not be reviewed until after contract award and will be
dispositioned in accordance with FAR 15.407-1 and FAR clause 52.215-10
or 52.215-11, as applicable; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(B) Consider the previous price agreement
null and void, and prior to award—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(1) Reopen negotiations to assess the impact
of the data submitted after the date of price agreement (“sweep
data”);</p>
         <p class="p List4">(2) Reestablish price agreement based on
cost or pricing data that is accurate, complete, and current as
of the date of the revised agreement on price; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(3) Request a new Certificate of Current
Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2, to include
the sweep data and any new or revised data submitted after the previous

         <p class="p List2">(iii) If a contractor persistently submits
untimely “sweep” data or fails to timely submit cost or pricing
data or the certification that the data are accurate, complete,
and current as of the data of price agreement, the contracting officer
should refer the matter to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)
via the Administrative Contracting Officer, Divisional Administrative
Contracting Officer, or Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer,
as appropriate, for consideration in DCAA’s review of the adequacy
of the contractor’s estimating system.</p>
