            <p class="p List4"> (A) A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2, shall be submitted as soon as practicable after agreement on price (preferably within 5 days after price agreement), but before contract award or execution of a modification (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts).</p>
            
            <p class="p List4"> (B) A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data that deviates from the language specified in FAR 15.406-2, or has been amended to include certification of data submitted after the date of price agreement, will not be accepted.</p>
            
            <p class="p List3"> (ii) If any data is submitted after the date of price agreement, contracting officers shall—</p>
            
            <p class="p List4"> (A) Notify offerors in writing that such data will not be reviewed until after contract award and will be dispositioned in accordance with FAR 15.407-1 and FAR clause 52.215-10 or 52.215-11, as applicable; or</p>

            <p class="p List6"> (<em class="ph i">1</em>) Reopen negotiations to assess the impact of the data submitted after the date of price agreement (“sweep data”);</p>
            
            <p class="p List6"> (<em class="ph i">2</em>) Reestablish price agreement based on cost or pricing data that is accurate, complete, and current as of the date of the revised agreement on price; and</p>
