         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Foreign military sales</em>. The Government self-insures through the use of the clause at 252.228-7001, which requires risk-mitigation procedures in lieu of private-sector, commercially-available hull insurance to cover the physical aircraft from damage or destruction, similar to the comprehensive portion of automobile insurance. It does not address personnel liability. For contracts falling under the exceptions at DFARS 228.371(b)(1)(iii), (iv), and (vi), review the commercial insurance policy to determine what coverage exists on the contract aircraft. Commercial hull insurance policies may contain various coverage exclusions, particularly for Government-furnished aircraft, which may mean the Government is at risk without the risk management safeguards provided through the Combined Instruction.</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (f) <em class="ph i">Damage to Government aircraft</em>. Whenever damage to Government aircraft is reported, particularly when the cost of repair exceeds the contractor’s share of loss provisions, the contracting officer shall make a proper liability determination. For most situations, determining whether an incident is an accident or mishap or a workmanship error can be made based on intent of the employee(s) involved. Although each incident involving damage should be evaluated on its own merits, use the following general rules and examples when determining if an incident constitutes an accident or mishap (damage normally covered under the clause at 252.228-7001) or a workmanship error (damage not normally covered under the clause at 252.228-7001).</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (1) An accident or mishap is the result of a task, operation, or action that was not originally planned or intended. For example, a mechanic was pushing a stand next to the aircraft and scratches the inlet coating. The intent of the task was to move the stand, not to scratch the coating. This would be considered accident or mishap damage to the aircraft, and a contractor should expect to be reimbursed under the clause at 252.228-7001 (minus the appropriate contractor share of loss).</p>
         <p class="p List2"> (2)(i) A workmanship error consists of damage that is the result of an incorrectly performed skill-based task, operation, or action that was originally planned or intended, but the end result was not within allowable limits. For example, a mechanic was scraping coating off an inlet and removed too much material. The intent of the task was to scrape the inlet coating, but too much was removed. This would not be considered aircraft damage reimbursed under the clause at 252.228-7001.</p>
         <p class="p List3"> (ii) Missing a step in a procedure or checklist item is not considered a skill-based error and therefore is not considered workmanship error damage.</p>
