         <p class="p Revised August 17, 2023 List2"> (4) Specify the period of time during which proposals submitted in response to the CSO will be accepted; and</p>

         <p class="p Revised August 17, 2023 List1"> (b) The contracting officer shall publicize the CSO through the Governmentwide point of entry and, if authorized pursuant to FAR subpart 5.5, may also publish a notice regarding the CSO in noted scientific, technical, or engineering periodicals.
