         <p class="p">As used in this subpart—</p>
         <p class="p">“Adequate security” means protective measures that are commensurate with the consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to, or modification of information.</p>
         <p class="p">“Contractor attributional/proprietary information” means information that identifies the contractor(s), whether directly or indirectly, by the grouping of information that can be traced back to the contractor(s) (e.g., program description, facility locations), personally identifiable information, as well as trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially sensitive information that is not customarily shared outside of the company.</p>
         <p class="p">“Controlled technical information” means technical information with military or space application that is subject to controls on the access, use, reproduction, modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination. Controlled technical information would meet the criteria, if disseminated, for distribution statements B through F using the criteria set forth in DoD Instruction 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents. The term does not include information that is lawfully publicly available without restrictions.</p>
         <p class="p">“Covered contractor information system” means an unclassified information system that is owned, or operated by or for, a contractor and that processes, stores, or transmits covered defense information.</p>
         <p class="p">“Covered defense information” means unclassified controlled technical information or other information (as described in the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Registry at http://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-list.html) that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Governmentwide policies, and is—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery order and provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in support of the performance of the contract; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract.</p>
         <p class="p">“Information system” means a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.</p>
         <p class="p">“Media” means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large-scale integration memory chips, and printouts onto which covered defense information is recorded, stored, or printed within a covered contractor information system.</p>
         <p class="p">“Rapidly report” means within 72 hours of discovery of any cyber incident.</p>
         <p class="p">“Technical information” means technical data or computer software, as those terms are defined in the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_252.2.html#DFARS_252.227-7013">252.227-7013</a> , Rights in Technical Data-Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, regardless of whether or not the clause is incorporated in the solicitation or contract. Examples of technical information include research and engineering data, engineering drawings, and associated lists, specifications, standards, process sheets, manuals, technical reports, technical orders, catalog-item identifications, data sets, studies and analyses and related information, and computer software executable code and source code.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">204.7302</span> Policy.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a)(1) Contractors and subcontractors
are required to provide adequate security on all covered contractor
information systems.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Contractors required to implement NIST
SP 800-171, in accordance with the clause at 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered
Defense Information and Cyber incident Reporting, are required at
time of award to have at least a Basic NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
that is current (i.e., not more than 3 years old unless a lesser
time is specified in the solicitation) (see 252.204-7019).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
Methodology is located at
               <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cyber/safeguarding.html#nistSP800171" target="_blank"> https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cyber/safeguarding.html#nistSP800171</a>
            .</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments
will be conducted by Government personnel using NIST SP 800-171A, “Assessing
Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information.”</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
will not duplicate efforts from any other DoD assessment or the
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) (see subpart 204.75),
except for rare circumstances when a re-assessment may be necessary,
such as, but not limited to, when cybersecurity risks, threats,
or awareness have changed, requiring a re-assessment to ensure current
compliance.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Contractors and subcontractors are
required to rapidly report cyber incidents directly to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
Subcontractors provide the incident report number automatically
assigned by DoD to the prime contractor. Lower-tier subcontractors
likewise report the incident report number automatically assigned
by DoD to their higher-tier subcontractor, until the prime contractor
is reached.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) If a cyber incident occurs, contractors
and subcontractors submit to DoD—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A cyber incident report;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Malicious software, if detected and
isolated; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Media (or access to covered contractor
information systems and equipment) upon request.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Contracting officers shall refer to
PGI <a class="xref 204.7303-4 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_204.7303-4.html#DFARS_PGI_PGI_204.7303-4">204.7303-4</a> (c) for instructions on
contractor submissions of media and malicious software.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Information shared by the contractor
may include contractor attributional/ proprietary information that
is not customarily shared outside of the company, and that the unauthorized
use or disclosure of such information could cause substantial competitive
harm to the contractor that reported the information. The Government
shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information
that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) A cyber incident that is reported by
a contractor or subcontractor shall not, by itself, be interpreted
as evidence that the contractor or subcontractor has failed to provide
adequate security on their covered contractor information systems,
or has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the clause at <a class="xref 252.204-7012 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_252.2.html#DFARS_252.204-7012">252.204-7012</a> ,
Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting.
When a cyber incident is reported, the contracting officer shall
consult with the DoD component Chief Information Officer/cyber security
office prior to assessing contractor compliance (see PGI <a class="xref 204.7303-3 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_204.7303-3.html#DFARS_PGI_PGI_204.7303-3">204.7303-3</a> (a)(3)). The contracting
officer shall consider such cyber incidents in the context of an
overall assessment of a contractor’s compliance with the requirements
of the clause at <a class="xref 252.204-7012 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_252.2.html#DFARS_252.204-7012">252.204-7012</a> .</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Support services contractors directly
supporting Government activities related to safeguarding covered
defense information and cyber incident reporting (e.g., forensic
analysis, damage assessment, or other services that require access
to data from another contractor) are subject to restrictions on
use and disclosure of reported information.</p>
