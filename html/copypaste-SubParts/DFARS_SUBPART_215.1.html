         <p class="p List3">(i)  Minimum requirements can be described clearly and comprehensively and expressed in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine the acceptability of offers;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  No, or minimal, value will be realized from a proposal that exceeds the minimum technical or performance requirements;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The proposed technical approaches will require no, or minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority as to the desirability of one offeror’s proposal versus a competing proposal; </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  The source selection authority has a high degree of confidence that reviewing the technical proposals of all offerors would not result in the identification of characteristics that could provide value or benefit; </p>

         <p class="p List3">(vii)  The contract file contains a determination that the lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs (as defined at FAR 7.101) of the product(s) or service(s) being acquired (see PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vii) for information on obtaining this determination); and</p>

See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_252.2.html#DFARS_252.209-7010">252.209-7010</a> for the definition and identification of critical safety items.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3) Contracting officers shall make award decisions based on best value factors and criteria, as determined by the resource sponsor (in accordance with agency procedures), for an auditing contract.
