         <p class="p List1">(a) For DoD, the following two-part
test determines whether a manufactured end product is a domestic
end product:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The end product is manufactured in
the United States; and</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (ii)(A) Except for an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components exceeds <span class="ph Revised February 15, 2024">60</span> percent of the cost of all its components<span class="ph Revised February 15, 2024">, except that the percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in calendar year 2029, but see paragraph (d) of this section.</span> This test is applied to end products only and not to individual components.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) For an end product that consists
            wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of iron and
            steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country must constitute less
            than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product. The cost of
            iron and steel not produced in the United States or a qualifying country includes but is
            not limited to the cost of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire,
            plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States or a
            qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith
            estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components not produced in the United States
            or a qualifying country, excluding commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)
            fasteners. The domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for
            acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.</p>

purchase of foreign end products are listed at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS_225.103">225.103</a>.</p>
         <p class="p Revised February 15, 2024"> (d)(1) In lieu of the threshold increases in FAR 25.101(a)(2)(i), use the domestic content threshold increases in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section. The senior procurement executive may approve application of an alternate domestic content test, under which the domestic content threshold in effect at the time of contract award will apply to the entire period of performance of the contract, following consultation with the Office of Management and Budget’s Made in America Office.

         <p class="p List4">(B) For procurements covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) has determined that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American statute to end products that are substantially transformed in the United States.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)(A) Normally, use the evaluation procedures in subpart 225.5, but consider recommending a public interest exception if the purposes of the Buy American statute are not served, or in order to meet a need set forth in 10 U.S.C. 4861. For example, a public interest exception may be appropriate—</p>

         <p class="p List4">(A) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;</p>

         <p class="p List4">(C) By the head of the contracting activity or immediate deputy for acquisitions valued at $1.5 million or more.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A separate determination as to whether an article is reasonably available is not required for the following articles. DoD has already determined that these articles are not reasonably available from domestic sources:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Spare or replacement parts that must be acquired from the original foreign manufacturer or supplier.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Foreign drugs acquired by the Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia, when the Director, Pharmaceuticals Group, Directorate of Medical Materiel, determines that only the requested foreign drug will fulfill the requirements.</p>
