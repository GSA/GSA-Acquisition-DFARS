      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1)  A basic principle of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System is that, upon contract award, contractors bring all the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, property, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them (reference FAR 9.104-1 (e), (f), and (g) of General Standards).  Therefore, upon contract award, responsible contractors should have the means to provide effective and efficient stewardship of Government property.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Government property, as defined at FAR 45.101, must be contractually accountable to a single contract and only one contract at a time. This requirement applies to both Government-furnished property and contractor-acquired property.  Although accountable to only one contract at a time, contract terms and conditions may allow Government property to be used on other contracts (see FAR 52.245-9, Use and Charges).</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The requiring activity (project or program manager, or purchase request generator), as part of its responsibility for acquisition planning (FAR part 7, Acquisition Planning), is the decision point as to whether or not to furnish property to contractors.  The basis for any decision to provide Government property shall be documented by the requiring activity and provided to the contracting officer.  Such documentation is not required when contractors are furnished property for repair, modification, or overhaul under a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Prior to furnishing Government property to the contractor, the contracting officer shall ensure that each of the requirements of FAR 45.102 are addressed as follows, and documented in the contracting file—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Element 1: In the Government’s best interest.</em> Discussion should be specific, factual, and where necessary, address actual or projected dollars and percentages.  Merely selecting one or two objectives supported by a general, perfunctory discussion does not address this element satisfactorily.  Discussion should address the following factors:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Economy – Furnishing Government property is the lowest cost or price alternative.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Standardization – There is a critical need for precise replication.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Security – Government property is needed due to national security issues/concerns.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Expedite production – Government property is crucial to achieving timely or accelerated delivery of a supply item or service.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Scarcity – The Government can obtain scarce items, or is the only source of property necessary for successful execution of a contract.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Maintain the industrial base – Government property is needed to ensure future capability to obtain a particular supply item or service.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Contract type – Government property will enable the Government to obtain a more favorable contract type.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Element 2</em>:  <em class="ph i">Overall benefit.</em>Demonstrate that the overall benefit to the acquisition significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including property disposal.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Property in the hands of contractors drives program costs.  Therefore, in order to make the case that providing Government property to the contractor is worthwhile, the associated costs must be considered and the business decision justified.  The costs of Government property removal and disposal, including demilitarization and disposal of environmentally-regulated property, must be included.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Costs must be either less than what the contractor might otherwise incur, or the demonstrated benefit to the Government must outweigh these additional contract costs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  <em class="ph i">Element 3:  Government assumption of risk.</em>  Demonstrate that providing the property does not substantially increase the Government’s risk.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Risk must be discussed and documented.  A risk analysis is warranted to demonstrate that the Government is not substantially increasing its risk.  For example, when furnishing Government property, the Government is ordinarily responsible for suitability of use, timely delivery, and replacement of defective Government property.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Other risks may need to be considered, discussed, and documented.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  <em class="ph i">Element 4:  Government requirements cannot otherwise be met</em>.  Document why the furnishing of Government property is critical and significant to meeting acquisition plan objectives.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">PGI 245.103-73</span> Government property under sustainment contracts.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) Sustainment contracts, including those for performance-based logistics, sustainment support, contractor logistics support, life-cycle product support, and weapon systems product support (see 10 U.S.C. 4324(d)), may require the contractor to hold or manage Government inventory. In such cases, regularly scheduled (typically, semiannually) inventory reporting from the contractor is required to ensure that inventory levels meet program requirements and Government inventory in excess of authorized amounts is identified. The requiring activity is responsible for providing the contracting officer with reporting requirements for Government inventory. See the Data Item Description DI-PSSS-80727A, Government Furnished Material (GFM) by National Stock Number, and the instructions for completing the DD Form 1423 Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) for inventory reporting requirements on sustainment
            contracts available at http://dodprocurementtoolbox.com/site-pages/gfp-resources.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  During acquisition planning, pricing contracts, exercising options, and assessing past performance, contracting officers should review the requiring activity’s assessment of the information generated by the inventory reporting requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In some circumstances, under fixed-price sustainment contracts, contract deliverables consist of non-hardware items, such as operational readiness rate goals or mean time between failures of a system. In order to meet these deliverables, contractors are required to provide certain property items to the Government. In such cases, the contract does not include specific delivery line items requiring formal delivery of the property. By extension, the Government will not have title to the property at the time the contractor provides the property. In such cases, title to the property passes to the Government upon Government acceptance (as defined in FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/46.101" target="_blank">46.101</a>) of the items at the destination stated in the contract. Contracting officers shall ensure that the contract— </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Clearly defines how and when acceptance will be performed; and </p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Includes applicable requirements for quality assurance, part marking, anti-counterfeiting, or other requirement for the delivery of the property.</p>
