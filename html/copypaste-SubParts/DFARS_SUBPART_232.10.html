         <p class="p List1">(a) As with all contract financing, the purpose of performance-based payments is to assist the contractor in the payment of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. See PGI <a class="xref 232.1001 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_232.1001.html#DFARS_PGI_232.1001">232.1001</a> (a) for additional information on use of performance-based payments. However, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3802(a)(2), performance-based payments shall not be conditioned upon costs incurred in contract performance, but on the achievement of performance outcomes. Subject to the criteria in <a class="xref 232.1003-70 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS_232.1003-70">232.1003-70</a> , all companies, including nontraditional defense contractors, are eligible for performance-based payments, consistent with best commercial practices.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  The contracting officer shall use the following standard payment terms for performance-based payments:  The contractor entitlement date, if any, specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.</p>

should include in a solicitation both the progress payments and
performance-based payments provisions and clauses prescribed in
this part, when considering both types of payment methods. Only
one type of financing will be included in the resultant contract,
except as may be authorized on separate orders subject to FAR 32.1003(c)).</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS_232.1004__PFeEcP">(ii) The contracting officer
shall analyze the performance-based payment schedule using the performance-based

payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-based
payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events,
completion criteria and event values along with the projected monthly
expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance
events such that the performance-based payments are not expected
to result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor
investment in the contract.</p>

contracts that already use performance-based payments financing,

the price for the modification;</p>
