         <p class="p List1">(a) When a cyber incident is reported by a contractor, the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) will send an unclassified encrypted email containing the cyber incident report to the contracting officer(s) identified on the Incident Collection Format (ICF). The DC3 may request the contracting officer send a digitally signed e-mail to DC3.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The procuring contracting officer (PCO) shall notify the requiring activities that have contracts identified in the ICF.
