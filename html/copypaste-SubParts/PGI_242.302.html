         <p class="p List2">(56) Assignment of a Government flight representative (GFR) may require execution of a secondary contract administration delegation, which is used to transfer contract administration responsibilities (see FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/42.302" target="_blank">42.302</a>(a)) from one contract administration office to another office or command. Secondary contract administration delegations are appropriate when, for example, contract work is performed at locations geographically separated from the contract administration office. In lieu of transferring contract administration responsibility through a secondary contract administration delegation, a GFR from one unit may be delegated GFR responsibility from an outside contract administration organization that has retained contract administration responsibility. This is accomplished through the use of a formal letter of agreement functionally assigning the GFR to the outside contract administration organization for the limited purpose of performing contract administration under FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/42.302" target="_blank">42.302</a>(a)(56).</p>
