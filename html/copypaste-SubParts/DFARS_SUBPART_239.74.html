         <p class="p List1">(a)  “Special construction” normally involves a common carrier giving a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements.  This may include—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)  Providing temporary facilities;</p>

         <p class="p List1">(c)  Special construction costs may be—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  A contingent liability for using telecommunications services for a shorter time than the minimum to reimburse the contractor for unamortized nonrecoverable costs.  These costs are usually expressed in terms of a termination liability, as provided in the contract or by tariff;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  A onetime special construction charge;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Recurring charges for constructed facilities;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  A minimum service charge;</p>

         <p class="p List1">(e)  When possible, analyze and approve special construction charges before receiving the service.  Impose a ceiling on the special construction costs before authorizing the contractor to proceed, if prior approval is not possible.  The contracting officer must approve special construction charges before final payment.</p>
