In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4863(m)(4), the term “required form” in this section refers to the form of the mill product, such as bar, billet, wire, slab, plate, or sheet, in the grade appropriate for the production of a finished end item to be delivered to the Government under this contract; or a finished component assembled into an end item to be delivered to the Government under the contract.

             if the USD(A&amp;S) determines in writing that acceptance of the item is necessary to the national security interests of the United States (see procedures at PGI 
               <a class="xref 225.7003-3 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_225.7003-3.html#DFARS_PGI_225.7003-3">225.7003-3</a>
            (d)). This authority may not be delegated.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The written determination of the USD(A&amp;S)—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Shall specify the quantity of end items to which the national security waiver applies;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Shall specify the time period over which the national security waiver applies; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Shall be provided to the congressional defense committees before the determination is executed, except that in the case of an urgent national security requirement, the determination may be provided to the congressional defense committees up to 7 days after it is executed.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) After making such a determination, the USD(A&amp;S) will—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Ensure that the contractor or subcontractor responsible for the noncompliant specialty metal develops and implements an effective plan to ensure future compliance; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Determine whether or not the noncompliance was knowing and willful. If the USD(A&amp;S) determines that the noncompliance was knowing and willful, the appropriate debarring and suspending official shall consider suspending or debarring the contractor or subcontractor until such time as the contractor or subcontractor has effectively addressed the issues that led to the noncompliance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Because national security waivers will only be granted when the acquisition in question is necessary to the national security interests of the United States, the requirement for a plan will be applied as a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent, to the granting of a waiver.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Application of the restriction would impede cooperative programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, or would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items under a memorandum of understanding providing for reciprocal procurement of defense items under
