         <p class="p List3">(B) The acquisition is for chemical warfare protective clothing, and the contracting officer has determined that an exception to domestic source requirements applies because the acquisition furthers an agreement with a qualifying country, in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_225.70.html#DFARS_225.7002-2">225.7002-2</a>(n).</p>
