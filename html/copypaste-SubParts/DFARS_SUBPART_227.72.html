      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p">The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_252.2.html#DFARS_252.227-7014">252.227-7014</a> , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Unlimited rights.</em>  The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a Government contract;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;</p>

             provides a nominal five-year period.  Either party may request a different period.  Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party.  Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the software.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the computer software.  Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the software including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes.  The Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights to any person unless—</p>

            , the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions.  Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.  Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights software or documentation.  Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)  Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights.  When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  List or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement made part of the contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection).  The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  <em class="ph i">Specifically negotiated license rights</em>.  Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights.  When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement.  If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure.  The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize others to do so.  Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  <em class="ph i">Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation</em>.  The clause at

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted restrictions.

After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to the person asserting the restriction.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.

         <p class="p List1">(f) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges.
