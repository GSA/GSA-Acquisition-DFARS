         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracting officers must purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. The Truthful Cost and Pricing statute (10 U.S.C. chapter 271 and 41 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires offerors to submit certified cost or pricing data if a procurement exceeds the Truthful Cost and Pricing threshold and none of the exceptions to certified cost or pricing data requirements applies. Under the Truthful Cost and Pricing statute, the contracting officer obtains accurate, complete, and current data from offerors to establish a fair and reasonable price (see FAR 15.403). The Truthful Cost and Pricing statute also allows for a price adjustment remedy if it is later found that a contractor did not provide accurate, complete, and current data.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) When certified cost or pricing data
are not required, and the contracting officer does not have sufficient
data to determine price reasonableness, FAR
15.402(a)(2) requires the offeror to provide whatever data
the contracting officer needs in order to determine fair and reasonable
prices.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Obtaining sufficient data from the offeror is particularly critical in situations where an item is determined to be a commercial product or service in accordance with FAR 2.101and the contract is being awarded on a sole source basis. This includes commercial sales data of products or services sold in similar quantities and, if such data is insufficient, cost data to support the proposed price.</p>

         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) In determining that an exceptional case TINA
waiver is appropriate, the head of the contracting activity (HCA) must exercise care to ensure that the
supplies or services could not be obtained without the waiver and that the
determination is clearly documented. <a class="xref" href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/2007-0195-DPAP.pdf" target="_blank">See DPAP March 23, 2007,
policy memorandum</a> . The intent is not to relieve entities that normally
perform Government contracts subject to TINA from an obligation to certify that
cost or pricing data are accurate, complete, and current. Instead, waivers must
be used judiciously, in situations where the Government could not otherwise
obtain a needed item without a waiver. A prime example would be when a
particular company offers an item that is essential to DoD’s mission but is not
available from other sources, and the company refuses to submit certified cost
or pricing data. In such cases, a waiver may be appropriate. However, the
procuring agency should, in conjunction with the waiver, develop a strategy for
procuring the item in the future that will not require such a waiver (e.g.,
develop a second source, develop an alternative product that satisfies the
department’s needs, or have DoD produce the item).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) <em class="ph i">Senior procurement executive

data may be waived for part of an offeror’s proposed price when it is possible
to clearly identify that part of the offeror’s cost proposal to which the waiver
applies as separate and distinct from the balance of the proposal. In granting a
partial waiver, in addition to complying with the requirements in DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="215.403-1.html#DFARS_215.403-1">215.403-1</a>(c)(4), the
(HCA) must address why it is in the

has no objection to certifying to the balance of its cost proposal.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) <em class="ph i">Waivers for unpriced supplies

         <span class="ph autonumber">PGI 215.403-3</span> Requiring
         dataother than certified cost or pricing data.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p">To the extent that certified cost or pricing data are not required
            by FAR 15.403-4 and there is no other means for the contracting
            officer to determine that prices are fair and reasonable, the
            offeror is required to submit “data other than certified cost or
            pricing data” (see definition at FAR 2.101). In accordance with FAR
            15.403-3(a), the offeror must provide appropriate data on the prices
            at which the same or similar items have previously been sold,
            adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price. The
            following clarifies these requirements:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Data other than certified</em>
            <em class="ph i">cost or pricing data</em>. When
            certified cost or pricing data are not required, the contracting
            officer must obtain whatever data is necessary in order to determine
            the reasonableness of the price. The FAR defines this as “data other
            than certified cost or pricing data.” When TINA does not apply and
            there is no other means of determining that prices are fair and
            reasonable, the contracting officer must obtain appropriate data on
            the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold
            previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.
            Sales data must be comparable to the quantities, capabilities,
            specifications, etc., of the product or service proposed. Sufficient
            steps must be taken to verify the integrity of the sales data, to
            include assistance from the Defense Contract Management Agency, the
            Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other agencies if required.
            See PGI 215.404-1 (DFARS/PGI view) for more detailed procedures for
            obtaining data from offerors to determine price reasonableness.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Previously been sold.
            Contracting officers shall request offerors to provide data related
            to prior sales (or “offered for sale”) in support of price
            reasonableness determinations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Adequacy of sales data
            for pricing. The contracting officer must determine if the prior
            sales data is sufficient for determining that prices are fair and
            reasonable. If the sales data is not sufficient, additional data
            shall be obtained, including cost data if necessary. See PGI
            215.404-1 (DFARS/PGI view) for more detailed procedures for
            obtaining whatever data is needed to determine fair and reasonable
            prices.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Analysis of historical prices
               paid by the Government</em>. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The contracting officer shall
            consider prices paid by the Government and commercial customers. The
            contracting officer shall not soley on a prior price paid by the
            Government, without further analysis (see FAR 15.404).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The contracting officer shall
            verify and document that sufficient analysis was performed to
            determine that the prior price was fair and reasonable. Sometimes,
            due to exigent situations, supplies or services are purchased even
            though an adequate price or cost analysis could not be performed.
            The problem is exacerbated when other contracting officers assume
            these prices were adequately analyzed and determined to be fair and
            reasonable. </p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The contracting officer also
            shall investigate and document the following considerations: </p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) verify that the
            quantities were similar for pricing purposes, making adjustments as
            necessary to ensure comparability with the current quantity
            requirement; </p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Consider whether the
            historical purchases were recent enough to be relevant for the
            purpose of establishing price reasonableness of the current
            acquisition, and escalate or deflate the historical prices as
            appropriate to facilitate comparison to the current proposed price;
            and </p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Validate that the terms
            and conditions associated with the historical purchases were
            comparable to the current terms and conditions, or adjust the
            historical prices in a manner that accounts for the materially
            differing terms and conditions . </p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Not verifying that a previous analysis was performed, or the consistencies in quantities, has been a recurring issue on sole source commercial products and commercial services reported by oversight organizations. Sole source commercial products and commercial services require extra attention to verify that previous prices paid on Government contracts were sufficiently analyzed and determined to be fair and reasonable. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) At a minimum, a contracting
            officer reviewing price history shall discuss the basis of previous
            prices paid with the contracting organization that previously bought
            the item. These discussions shall be documented in the contract
            file.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Canadian Commercial
               Corporation.</em> All contracts with the Canadian Commercial
            Corporation (CCC) are placed in accordance with the practices,

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">General</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The objective of proposal analysis
is to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) When the contracting officer needs
data to determine price reasonableness and the offeror will not
furnish that data, use the following sequence of steps to resolve
the issue:</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) The contracting officer should make it clear
what data is required and why it is needed to determine fair and reasonable
prices, and should be flexible in requesting data in existing formats with
appropriate explanations from the offeror.</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) If the offeror refuses to provide the data,
the contracting officer should elevate the issue within the contracting
activity.</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) Contracting activity management shall, with
support from the contracting officer, discuss the issue with appropriate levels
of the offeror’s management.</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) If the offeror continues to refuse to provide
the data, contracting activity management shall elevate the issue to the head of
the contracting activity for a decision in accordance with FAR
15.403-3(a)(4).</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">v</em>) The contracting officer shall document the
contract file to describe—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">a</em>) The data requested and the contracting
officer’s need for that data;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">b</em>) Why there is currently no other alternative
but to procure the item from this particular source; and</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">c</em>) A written plan for avoiding this situation in
the future (e.g., develop a second source by...; bring the procurement in house
to the Government by...).</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">vi</em>) Consistent with the requirements at FAR
15.304 and 42.1502 and the DoD Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance
Information, Version 3, dated May 2003, the contracting officer shall, unless exempted by the HCA, provide
input into the past performance system, noting the offeror’s refusal to provide
the requested information.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) In some cases, supplies
or services that are not subject to TINA may require a cost analysis (see
paragraph (c) of this section). This
will occur when a price analysis is not sufficient for determining prices to be
fair and reasonable. In such cases, the contracting officer should consider the
need for a Defense Contract Audit Agency audit of the cost data.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Particular attention should be paid to sole source commercial products or commercial services. While the order of preference at FAR 15.402 must be followed, if the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness without obtaining data other than cost or pricing data from the offeror, at a minimum, the contracting officer must obtain appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously (often previous sales data was the basis of the commercial item determination and must be requested during price analysis of the data provided by the offeror). If previous sales data is not sufficient to determine price reasonableness, the contracting officer must obtain “data other than certified cost or pricing data” and, if necessary, perform a cost analysis.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Analysis of termination proposals,
including termination of any contract scope, should not rely solely
on earned value management budgets or estimates for estimating the
costs of all work deleted, or the cost of deleted work already performed
(reference FAR Subpart 15.4,
Table 15-2—Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When
Certified Cost or Pricing Data are Required, columns (2) and (3)
of section III.B., Change Orders, Modifications, and Claims).</p>

         <p class="p List3">(v) Contracting officers must
obtain and document sufficient data to confirm that previous prices paid by the
Government were based on a thorough price and/or cost analysis. For example, it
would not be sufficient to use price(s) from a database paid by another
contracting officer without understanding the type of analysis that was
performed to determine the reasonableness of
the price(s), and without verifying that the quantities were similar for
pricing purposes. This does not necessarily need to be another analysis, but
there should be coordination with the other office that acknowledges an analysis
was performed previously.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Cost analysis</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) When the contracting officer cannot
obtain sufficient data to perform a price analysis in accordance
with the pricing steps in FAR
15.404-1(b), a cost analysis is required.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When a solicitation is not subject
to TINA and a cost analysis is required, the contracting officer
must clearly communicate to the offeror the cost data that will
be needed to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) To the extent possible, when cost
or pricing data are not required to be submitted in accordance with
Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408,
the contracting officer should accept the cost data in a format
consistent with the offeror’s records.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The contracting officer must always
consider the need for field pricing support from the Defense Contract
Management Agency, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and/or other
agencies.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Technical analysis</em>. Requesting technical assistance is particularly important when evaluating pricing related to items that are “similar to” items being purchased or commercial products or commercial services that are “of a type” or require “minor modifications.” Technical analysis can assist in pricing these types of items by identifying any differences between the item being acquired and the “similar to” item. In particular, the technical review can assist in evaluating the changes that are required to get from the “similar to” item, to the item being solicited, so the contracting officer can determine sufficient price/cost analysis techniques when evaluating that the price for the item being solicited is fair and reasonable.

         <p class="p List1">(a) The contracting officer should consider the need for field pricing analysis and evaluation of lower-tier subcontractor proposals, and assistance to prime contractors when they are being denied access to lower-tier subcontractor records.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) When obtaining field pricing assistance on a prime contractor’s proposal, the contracting officer should request audit or field pricing assistance to analyze and evaluate the proposal of a subcontractor at any tier (notwithstanding availability of data or analyses performed by the prime contractor) if the contracting officer believes that such assistance is necessary to ensure the reasonableness of the total proposed price. Such assistance may be appropriate when, for example—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) There is a business relationship between the contractor and the subcontractor not conducive to independence and objectivity;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The contractor is a sole source supplier and the subcontract costs represent a substantial part of the contract cost;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The contractor has been denied access to the subcontractor’s records;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) The contracting officer determines that, because of factors such as the size of the proposed subcontract price, audit or field pricing assistance for a subcontract at any tier is critical to a fully detailed analysis of the prime contractor’s proposal;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) The contractor or higher-tier subcontractor has been cited for having significant estimating system deficiencies in the area of subcontract pricing, especially the failure to perform adequate cost analyses of proposed subcontract costs or to perform subcontract analyses prior to negotiation of the prime contract with the Government; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) A lower-tier subcontractor has been cited as having significant estimating system deficiencies.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) It may be appropriate for the contracting officer or the ACO to provide assistance to a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, when the contractor or higher-tier subcontractor has been denied access to a subcontractor’s records in carrying out the responsibilities at FAR 15.404-3 to conduct price or cost analysis to determine the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices. Under these circumstances, the contracting officer or the ACO should consider whether providing audit or field pricing assistance will serve a valid Government interest.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When DoD performs the subcontract analysis, DoD shall furnish to the prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor, with the consent of the subcontractor reviewed, a summary of the analysis performed in determining any unacceptable costs included in the subcontract proposal. If the subcontractor withholds consent, DoD shall furnish a range of unacceptable costs for each element in such a way as to prevent disclosure of subcontractor proprietary data.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Price redeterminable or fixed-price incentive contracts may include subcontracts placed on the same basis. When the contracting officer wants to reprice the prime contract even though the contractor has not yet established final prices for the subcontracts, the contracting officer may negotiate a firm contract price—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) If certified cost or pricing data on the subcontracts show the amounts to be reasonable and realistic; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) If certified cost or pricing data on the subcontracts are too indefinite to determine whether the amounts are reasonable and realistic, but—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Circumstances require prompt negotiation; and</p>

Resolving Contract Audit Recommendations</a>. When a significant
disagreement arises on questioned costs, the contracting officer
and the auditor shall discuss the basis of the disagreement. The
contracting officer shall document that discussion and their disagreement
in a written communication to the auditor. The contracting officer
shall also document the disagreement in the prenegotiation objective

as the contracting officer planning to sustain less than 75-percent
of the total recommended questioned costs in a Defense Contract
Audit Agency (DCAA) audit report of a contractor proposal for an
initial contract or a contract modification with a value equal to
or greater than $10 million. It does not apply to costs that DCAA
has categorized as unsupported or unresolved in its audit report.</p>

has three days to elevate the issues within the contracting officer’s
activity after receipt of the contracting officers’ written communication
confirming the disagreement. Furthermore, DCAA may appeal the significant
issues up the chain of command as established in each Component’s
“Resolving Contract Audit Recommendations” policy. If issues remain,
the Director, DCAA may escalate from the Defense Component’s Head
of Contracting Activity or Senior Procurement Executive, to the
Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP). If
the DCAA Director believes that the Director, DPAP has not adequately
addressed the matter, the disagreement may finally be elevated to
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics,
and the Comptroller.</p>
