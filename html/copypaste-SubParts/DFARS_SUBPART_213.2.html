         <p class="p List3">(ii) The contracting office is seeking a source that accepts the purchase card.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) To prevent mission delays, if an activity does not have a resident general or flag officer or SES member, delegation of this authority to the level of the senior local commander or director is permitted; or</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The purchase or payment meets one or more of the following criteria:</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4) The purchase is a transaction in support of intelligence or other specialized activities addressed by 2.7 of Executive Order 12333.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) It involves a controlled substance or narcotic;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) It requires the submission of a Health Care Summary Record to document the nature of the care purchased;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The ultimate price of the medical care is subject to an independent determination that changes the price paid based on application of a mandatory CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge determination that reduces the Government liability below billed charges;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The Government already has entered into a contract to pay for the services without the use of a purchase card;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) The purchaser is a beneficiary seeking medical care; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) The senior local commander or director of a hospital or laboratory determines that use of the purchase card is not appropriate or cost-effective.
