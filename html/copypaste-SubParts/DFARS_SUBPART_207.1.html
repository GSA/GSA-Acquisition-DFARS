         <p class="p List2">(S-70)(1) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3774(a) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems shall—</p>

and computer software needs of those systems and subsystems; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Establish acquisition strategies that
provide for the technical data deliverables and associated license
rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems over their

competition, at both the prime contract level and subcontract level
(at such tier or tiers as are appropriate) throughout the program
life cycle as a means to improve contractor performance; and</p>

cost-effective measures intended to achieve the following:</p>

“make-or-buy” decisions by prime contractors, acquisition strategies
and resultant solicitations and contracts shall—</p>

and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the prime
contractor for the development or construction of major subsystems
and components of major weapon systems;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Provide for Government surveillance
of the process by which prime contractors consider such sources
and determine whether to conduct such development or construction
in-house or through a subcontract; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Provide for the assessment of the
extent to which the prime contractor has given full and fair consideration
to qualified sources in sourcing decisions as a part of past performance
evaluations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Whenever a source-of-repair decision
results in a plan to award a contract for the performance of maintenance
and sustainment services on a major weapon system, to the maximum
extent practicable and consistent with statutory requirements, the
acquisition plan shall prescribe that award will be made on a competitive
basis after giving full consideration to all sources (including
sources that partner or subcontract with public or private sector
repair activities).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4328, acquisition plans for engineering manufacturing and development and production of major systems as defined in 10 U.S.C. 3041(a) and 4202 and for major defense acquisition programs as defined in <a class="xref 202.101 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_202.1.html#DFARS_202.101">202.101</a> , shall include performance measures that are developed using best practices for responding to the positive or negative performance of a contractor for the engineering and manufacturing development or production of a weapon system, including embedded software. At a minimum the contracting officer shall—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Encourage the use of incentive fees
and penalties as appropriate; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Allow the program manager or comparable
requiring activity official exercising program management responsibilities,
to base determinations of a contractor’s performance on reliability
and maintainability data collected during the program. Such data
collection and associated evaluation metrics shall be described
in detail in the contract; and to the maximum extent practicable,
the data shall be shared with appropriate contractor and Government
organizations.</p>
         <p class="p">(S-73) In accordance with section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapons systems shall include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for major defense acquisition programs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) may waive this requirement if USD(A&amp;S) determines that it is in the best interest of DoD.</p>
