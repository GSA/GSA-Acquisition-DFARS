      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) Requiring departments send their requirements to acquiring departments on either a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), or a DD Form 416, Requisition for Coal, Coke or Briquettes. A MIPR or a DD Form 416 is the acquiring department's authority to acquire the supplies or services on behalf of the requiring department.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The acquiring department is authorized to create obligations against the funds cited in a MIPR without further referral to the requiring department. The acquiring department has no responsibility to determine the validity of a stated requirement in an approved MIPR, but it should bring apparent errors in the requirement to the attention of the requiring department.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Changes that affect the contents of the MIPR must be processed as a MIPR amendment regardless of the status of the MIPR. The requiring department may initially transmit changes electronically or by some other expedited means, but must confirm changes by a MIPR amendment.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The requiring department must submit requirements for additional line items of supplies or services not provided for in the original MIPR as a new MIPR. The requiring department may use a MIPR amendment for increased quantities only if—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The original MIPR requirements have not been released for solicitation; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The acquiring department agrees.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">PGI 208.7004-2</span> Acceptance by acquiring department.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) Acquiring departments formally accept a MIPR by DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR, as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after receipt of the MIPR. If the 30 day time limit cannot be met, the acquiring department must inform the requiring department of the reason for the delay, and the anticipated date the MIPR will be accepted. The acquiring department must accept MIPRs in writing before expiration of the funds.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The acquiring department in accepting a MIPR will determine whether to use Category I (reimbursable funds citation) or Category II (direct funds citation) methods of funding.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Category I method of funding is used under the following circumstances and results in citing the funds of the acquiring department in the contract:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Delivery is from existing inventories of the acquiring department;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Delivery is by diversion from existing contracts of the acquiring department;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Production or assembly is through Government work orders in Government-owned plants;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Production quantities are allocated among users from one or more contracts, and the identification of specific quantities of the end item to individual contracts is not feasible at the time of MIPR acceptance;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Acquisition of the end items involves separate acquisition of components to be assembled by the acquiring department;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Payments will be made without reference to deliveries of end items (e.g., cost-reimbursement type contracts and fixed-price contracts with progress payment clauses); or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Category II method of funding is not feasible and economical.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Category II method of funding is used in circumstances other than those in paragraph (2)(i) of this subsection. Category II funding results in citation of the requiring department's funds and MIPR number in the resultant contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When the acquiring departments accepts a MIPR for Category I funding—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR, is the authority for the requiring department to record the obligation of funds;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The acquiring department will annotate the DD Form 448-2 if contingencies, price revisions, or variations in quantities are anticipated. The acquiring department will periodically advise the requiring department, prior to submission of billings, of any changes in the acceptance figure so that the requiring department may issue an amendment to the MIPR, and the recorded obligation may be adjusted to reflect the current price;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) If the acquiring department does not qualify the acceptance of a MIPR for anticipated contingencies, the price on the acceptance will be final and will be billed at time of delivery; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Upon receipt of the final billing (SF 1080, Voucher for Transferring Funds), the requiring department may adjust the fiscal records accordingly without authorization from or notice to the acquiring department.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) When the MIPR is accepted for Category II funding, a conformed copy of the contract (see DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_204.8.html#DFARS_204.802">204.802</a>(1)(ii)) is the authority to record the obligation. When all awards have been placed to satisfy the total MIPR requirement, any unused funds remaining on the MIPR become excess to the acquiring department. The acquiring department will immediately notify the requiring department of the excess funds by submitting an Acceptance of MIPR (DD Form 448-2). This amendment is authorization for the requiring department to withdraw the funds. The acquiring department is prohibited from further use of such excess funds.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) When the acquiring department requires additional funds to complete the contracting action for the requiring department, the request for additional funds must identify the exact items involved, and the reason why additional funds are required. The requiring department shall act quickly to—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Provide the funds by an amendment of the MIPR; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Reduce the requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The accepting activity of the acquiring department shall remain responsible for the MIPR even though that activity may split the MIPR into segments for action by other contracting activities.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List2">(1) An advance MIPR is an unfunded MIPR provided to the acquiring department in advance of the funded MIPR so that initial steps in planning the contract action can begin at an earlier date.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In order to use an advance MIPR, the acquiring department and the requiring department must agree that its use will be beneficial. The departments may execute a blanket agreement to use advance MIPRs.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The requiring department shall not release an advance MIPR to the acquiring department without obtaining proper internal approval of the requirement.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) When advance MIPRs are used, mark “ADVANCE MIPR” prominently on the DD Form 448.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) For urgent requirements, the advance MIPR may be transmitted electronically.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) On the basis of an advance MIPR, the acquiring department may take the initial steps toward awarding a contract, such as obtaining internal coordination and preparing an acquisition plan. Acquiring departments may determine the extent of these initial actions but shall not award contracts on the basis of advance MIPRs.</p>

If circumstances arise that require the submission of MIPRs citing expiring appropriations after the cutoff date, the requiring department will communicate with the acquiring department before submission to find out whether the acquiring department can execute a contract or otherwise obligate the funds by the end of the fiscal year. Acquiring departments will make every effort to obligate funds for all such MIPRs accepted after the cutoff date. However, acceptance of a late MIPR does not constitute assurance by the acquiring department that all such funds will be obligated.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) If the acquiring department has not entered into a contract for the supplies or services to be cancelled, the acquiring department will immediately notify the requiring department.

         <p class="p List4">(B) The termination contracting officer (TCO) will review the proceedings at least every 60 days to reassess the Government's probable obligation. If any additional funds are excess to the probable settlement requirements, or if it appears that previous release of excess funds will result in a shortage of the amount that will be required for settlement, the TCO will promptly notify the contracting office which will amend the termination data letter.
