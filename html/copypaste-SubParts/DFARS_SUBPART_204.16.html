         <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Establishment of a Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID).</em>  Do not reuse a PIID once it has been assigned.  Do not assign the same PIID to more than one task or delivery order, even if they are issued under different base contracts or agreements.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(D)  Shall not be used to evade competition requirements, expand the scope of work, or extend the period of performance beyond that of the predecessor contract.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  When issuing a continued contract, the contracting officer shall—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Positions 10 through 17.</em> In accordance with FAR 4.1603(a)(4), DoD-issued PIIDs shall only use positions 10 through 13 to complete the PIID. Enter the serial number of the instrument in these positions. A separate series of serial numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in FAR 4.1603(a)(3). DoD components assign such series of PIID numbers sequentially. A DoD component may reserve blocks of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various activities. <span class="ph Revised August 17, 2023">Use C in position 10 to identify the solicitation as a commercial solutions opening.</span>

         <p class="p List1">(b)  <em class="ph i">Elements of a supplementary PIID.</em>  In addition to the supplementary PIID numbering procedures in FAR 4.1603(b), follow the procedures contained in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(<em class="ph i">1</em>) and (<em class="ph i">2</em>) of this section.  See PGI

         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  <em class="ph i">Positions 2 and 3</em>.  These two digits may be either alpha or numeric characters, except—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">i</em>)  Use K, L, M, N, P, and Q only in position 2, and only if the modification is issued by the Air Force and is a provisioned item order;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>)  Use S only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">a</em>)  The contract has either FOB origin or destination delivery terms; and</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">b</em>)  The price changes;</p>

         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)  <em class="ph i">Positions 4 through 6</em>.  These positions are always numeric.  Use a separate series of serial numbers for each type of modification listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p>
