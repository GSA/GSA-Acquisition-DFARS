         <p class="p List2">(1) An identifier assigned to entities located in the United States or its outlying areas by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch to identify a commercial or government entity by unique location; or </p>

         <p class="p">“Contractor-acquired property,” “contractor inventory,” “Government property,” “Government-furnished property,” and “loss of Government property” have the meanings given in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.245-1" target="_blank">52.245-1</a>, Government Property, clause of this contract. </p>
         <p class="p">“Demilitarization” means the act of eliminating the functional capabilities and inherent military design features from DoD personal property. Methods and degree range from removal and destruction of critical features to total destruction by cutting, tearing, crushing, mangling, shredding, melting, burning, etc. </p>
