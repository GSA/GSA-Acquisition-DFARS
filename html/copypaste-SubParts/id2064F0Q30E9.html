         <p class="p List1">(a) This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, preparation, and distribution of the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) Receiving Report (RR), WAWF Reparable Receiving Report (WAWF RRR), the WAWF Energy RR, and commercial shipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance. The WAWF RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR). The WAWF Energy RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for overland shipments and DD Form 250-1, Tanker/Barge Material Inspection and Receiving Report, for waterborne shipments. The WAWF RRR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for repair, maintenance, or overhaul of Government-furnished property.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The use of the DD Form 250 series documents is on an exception basis (see DFARS (a)) because use of the WAWF RR is now required by most DoD contracts. WAWF provides for electronic preparation and documentation of acceptance of supplies and services, and electronic invoicing. In addition WAWF allows the printing of a RR that can be used as a packing list or when a signed copy is required.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">F-103</span> Use.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, and the DD Form 250 are multipurpose reports used—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) To provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or destination;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin, destination, or other;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) For packing lists;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) For receiving;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) For shipping;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) As a contractor invoice (the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, or DD Form 250 alone cannot be used as an invoice, however the option exists to create an invoice from the Receiving Report or a Combo (Invoice and Receiving Report) both of which minimize data entry); and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) As commercial invoice support.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Do not use the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, or the DD Form 250 for shipments—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) By subcontractors, unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Of contract inventory. The WAWF Property Transfer document should be used for this type of shipment. Training for the preparation of this document type is available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil, under the Property Transfer and Receipt section.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The contractor prepares the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, or the DD Form 250, except for entries that an authorized Government representative is required to complete. When using a paper DD Form 250, the contractor shall furnish sufficient copies of the completed form, as directed by the Government representative.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Use the WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) For bulk movements of petroleum products by tanker or barge to cover—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at product source. Annotate the forms with the words “INSPECTED FOR QUALITY ONLY.”</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) In addition to the above uses, the WAWF RR and WAWF RRR provide additional functionality, not provided by the paper DD Form 250 that complies with the following requirements:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Item Unique Identification (IUID), when the clause at DFARS , Item Unique Identification and Valuation is used in the contract, reporting of IUID data is required. WAWF captures the IUID data and forwards the data to the IUID registry after acceptance. WAWF shall be used to report Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) at the line item level, unless an exception to WAWF applies, and can also be used to report UIIs embedded at the line item level.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), when the clause at DFARS , Radio Frequency Identification, is used in the contract, WAWF will capture the RFID information and forward the data to the receiving location. Using WAWF is the only way a contractor can comply with the clause to furnish RFID data via an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN). The RFID information may be added at time of submission, or via the WAWF Pack Later functionality after acceptance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Reporting of Government-furnished property, when the clause at DFARS , Reporting of Government-Furnished Property, is used in the contract, use of the WAWF RRR will capture the shipment of Government-furnished property items after acceptance of repair services and forward the data to the IUID registry. WAWF is the only way a contractor can report the transfer of Government-furnished property items in the IUID registry.</p>

      <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title5">
         <span class="ph autonumber">F-104</span> Application.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) WAWF RR and DD Form 250.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, that indicate no DD Form 250 is required.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, contractors may prepare one WAWF RR or DD Form 250 to cover all such shipments.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for the contents of each vehicle.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the shipment includes items of more than one Federal supply class (FSC) or material management code (MMC), prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for items of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant Government representative may authorize a single WAWF RR or DD Form 250, listing each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock number applicable to the item.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD Form 250.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contiguous United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line item, on one WAWF RR or DD Form 250. To permit verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document (commercial or Government) with each individual load showing as a minimum—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The shipper;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Shipping point;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Consignee;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Contract and line item number;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Product identification;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) Gross gallons (bulk only);</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) Loading temperature (bulk only);</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);</p>
         <p class="p List4">(I) Identification of carrier's equipment;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(J) Serial number of all seals applied; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(K) Signature of supplier's representative.</p>
         <p class="p List4">When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) before signing Block 21b.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for contiguous United States applies, except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable to the receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than one contract line item in each WAWF RR or DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and acceptance data are the same for all line items.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD 250. Contractors may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, on one WAWF RR or DD 250. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a commercial shipping document with each individual truck load showing as a minimum—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The shipper;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The name or names;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which the coal originates;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The contract number;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the truckload.</p>
         <p class="p List4">Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify each railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) WAWF RRR or DD Form 250. Use as in paragraph (a) of this section for delivery of services for repair, overhaul, or maintenance.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge cargo loaded.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same destination.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product loaded.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each grade of product discharged.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if from the same loading source.</p>
