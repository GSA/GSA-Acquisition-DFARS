            , Rights in Technical Data–Noncommercial Items.  In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration.  In those cases, a special license may be negotiated.  However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license.  The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(5)  Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);</p>

         <p class="p List2">(7)  Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i)  That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable.  The clause at

             provides a nominal five-year period.  Either party may request a different period.  Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party.  Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development.  Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes.

            , the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions.  Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.  Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data.  Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  <em class="ph i">Limited rights</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The Government obtains limited rights in technical data—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  That pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release, or disclosure that is—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; </p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  To a covered Government support contractor; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at

         <p class="p List1">(d)  <em class="ph i">Specifically negotiated license rights.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights.  When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement.  The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than limited rights in such data.  The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data.  Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights.  Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a)  Contractor data repositories may be established when permitted by agency procedures.  The contractual instrument establishing the data repository must require, as a minimum, the data repository management contractor to—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Establish and maintain adequate procedures for protecting technical data delivered to or stored at the repository from unauthorized release or disclosure;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Establish and maintain adequate procedures for controlling the release or disclosure of technical data from the repository to third parties consistent with the Government's rights in such data;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  When required by the contracting officer, deliver data to the Government on paper or in other specified media;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  Be responsible for maintaining the currency of data delivered directly by Government contractors or subcontractors to the repository;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  Obtain use and non-disclosure agreements (see

         <p class="p List2">(6)  Indemnify the Government from any liability to data owners or licensors resulting from, or as a consequence of, a release or disclosure of technical data made by the data repository contractor or its officers, employees, agents, or representatives.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  If the contractor is or will be the data repository manager, the contractor's data management and distribution responsibilities must be identified in the contract or the contract must reference the agreement between the Government and the contractor that establishes those responsibilities.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  If the contractor is not and will not be the data repository manager, do not require a contractor or subcontractor to deliver technical data marked with limited rights legends to a data repository managed by another contractor unless the contractor or subcontractor who has asserted limited rights agrees to release the data to the repository or has authorized, in writing, the Government to do so.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  Repository procedures may provide for the acceptance, delivery, and subsequent distribution of technical data in storage media other than paper, including direct electronic exchange of data between two computers.  The procedures must provide for the identification of any portions of the data provided with restrictive legends, when appropriate.  The acceptance criteria must be consistent with the authorized delivery format.</p>
