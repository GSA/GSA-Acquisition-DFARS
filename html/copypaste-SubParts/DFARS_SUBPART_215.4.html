         <p class="p List4">(B)  Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data.  However, no cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions, quantities, and market and economic factors (see <a class="xref fm:TEXT" href="PGI_215.404-1.html#DFARS_PGI_PGI_215.404-1">PGI 215.404-1 Proposal analysistechniques.</a>(b)(v)). For similar items, the contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)). Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating the relevance of the information available:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  <em class="ph i">Market prices</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  <em class="ph i">Age of data</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry (e.g., rapidly evolving technologies), product maturity (e.g., stable), economic factors (e.g., new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)  A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the anticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be expected to materially influence the contracting officer’s determination of price reasonableness.  The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as they may have information about pending sales.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  <em class="ph i">Volume and completeness of transaction data</em>.  Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to represent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers.  The data must also include key information, such as date, quantity sold, part number, part nomenclature, sales price, and customer.  If the number of transactions is insufficient or the data is incomplete, the contracting officer shall request additional sales data to evaluate price reasonableness.  If the contractor cannot provide sufficient sales data, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  <em class="ph i">Nature of transactions</em>.  The nature of a sales transaction includes the information necessary to understand the transaction, such as terms and conditions, date, quantity sold, sale price, unique requirements, the type of customer (government, distributor, retail end-user, etc.), and related agreements.  It also includes warranties, key product technical specifications, maintenance agreements, and preferred customer rewards.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi)  The contracting officer shall consider catalog prices to be reliable when they are regularly maintained and supported by relevant sales data (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments).  The contracting officer may request that the offeror support differences between the proposed price(s), catalog price(s), and relevant sales data.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) The contracting officer may consult with the DoD cadre of experts who are available to provide expert advice to the acquisition workforce in assisting with commercial product or commercial service determinations and price reasonableness determinations. The DoD cadre of experts is identified at PGI <a class="xref 215.404-1 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_215.404-1.html#DFARS_PGI_PGI_215.404-1">215.404-1</a> (b)(vii).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) When procuring a service or an

Except for the cost efficiency special factor, each profit factor has a normal value and a designated range of values. The normal value is representative of average conditions on the prospective contract when compared to all goods and services acquired by DoD. The designated range provides values based on above normal or below normal conditions. In the price negotiation documentation, the contracting officer need not explain assignment of the normal value, but should address conditions that justify assignment of other than the normal value. The cost efficiency special factor has no normal value.

The contracting officer may assign values within the technology
incentive range when contract performance includes the introduction
of new, significant technological innovation. Use the technology
incentive range only for the most innovative contract efforts. Innovation
may be in the form of -</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Development or application of new technology
that fundamentally changes the characteristics of an existing product

technology incentive range, the contracting officer should consider
the relative value of the proposed innovation to the acquisition
as a whole. When the innovation represents a minor benefit, the contracting
officer should consider using values less than the norm. For innovative
efforts that will have a major positive impact on the product or
program, the contracting officer may use values above the norm.</p>

approach to controlling cost and schedule; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) Any other factors that affect the
contractor's ability to meet the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency
exchange rates and inflation rates).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Above normal conditions.</em> (i)
The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when
there is a high degree of management effort. Indicators of this
are -</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The contractor's value added is both
considerable and reasonably difficult;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The effort involves a high degree of
integration or coordination;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The contractor has a good record of
past performance;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) The contractor has a substantial record
of active participation in Federal socioeconomic programs;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) The contractor provides fully documented
and reliable cost estimates;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy
decisions; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) The contractor has a proven record
of cost tracking and control.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The contracting officer may justify
a maximum value when the effort -</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Requires large scale integration of
the most complex nature;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Involves major international activities
with significant management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign
vendors); or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Has critically important milestones.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) If the contractor demonstrates efficient
management and cost control through the submittal of a timely, qualifying proposal
(as defined in217.7401) in furtherance of definitization of an undefinitized
contract action, and the proposal demonstrates effective cost control
from the time of award to the present, the contracting officer may
add 1 percentage point to the value determined for management/cost
control up to the maximum of 7 percent.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Below normal conditions.</em> (i)
The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when
the management effort is minimal. Indicators of this are -</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The program is mature and many end
item deliveries have been made;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The contractor adds minimal value to
an item;</p>

         <p class="p List4">(F) The contractor does not cooperate in
the evaluation and negotiation of the proposal;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) The contractor's cost estimating system
is marginal;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) The contractor has made minimal effort
to initiate cost reduction programs;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(I) The contractor's cost proposal is inadequate;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(J) The contractor has a record of cost
overruns or another indication of unreliable cost estimates and
lack of cost control; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(K) The contractor has a poor record of
past performance.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The following may justify a value
significantly below normal -</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Reviews performed by the field contract
administration offices disclose unsatisfactory management and internal control
systems (e.g., quality assurance, property control, safety, security);
or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The effort requires an unusually low

The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.</p>

            officer shall assess the extent to which costs have been incurred
            prior to definitization of the contract action (also see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_217.74.html#DFARS_217.7404-6">217.7404-6</a>(a) and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS_SUBPART_243.2.html#DFARS_243.204-70">243.204-70</a>-6). When considering the reduced cost risks
            associated with allowable incurred costs on an undefinitized
            contract action, it is appropriate to apply separate contract risk
            factors for allowable incurred costs and estimated costs to complete
            when completing the contract risk sections of DD Form 1547, Record
            of Weighted Guidelines. When costs have been incurred prior to
            definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be in the
            low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the
            costs has been incurred prior to
            definitization, the contracting officer may assign a value as low as
            zero percent, regardless of contract type. However, if a contractor
            submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized
            contract action and the contracting officer for such action
            definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period
            beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the

         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Contract facilities capital estimates</em>.
The contracting officer shall estimate the facilities capital cost
of money and capital employed using—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms
CASB-CMF and cost of money factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and</p>

for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Purpose</em>. The DD Form 1861 provides
a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted
Guidelines Application. It—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Enables the contracting officer to
differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land,
buildings, equipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead
rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract
overhead costs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Is designed to record and compute
the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed
which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Completion instructions</em>. Complete
a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal,
establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation
objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) List overhead pools and direct-charging
service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on
the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure
and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three
displays.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead
allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown
or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead
pool and direct-charging service center.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Multiply each allocation base by
its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital
cost of money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these
products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of
money for the year's effort.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Total contract facilities cost of
money is the sum of the yearly amounts.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Since the facilities capital cost of
money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column
1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same
rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Preaward facilities capital applications</em>.
To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital
cost of money and capital employed as follows:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Cost of Money.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Cost Objective</em>. Use the imputed
facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to
establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an
incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established
at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available
during the period of contract performance.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Profit Objective</em>. When measuring
the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation
profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs.
Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a)  This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs.  To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to evaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The contractor’s participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4)  The contractor’s cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information technology).  Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor’s cost reduction initiatives over time;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  The contractor’s adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) The contractor’s effective incorporation of commercial products or commercial services and commercial processes; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8)  The contractor’s investment in new facilities when such investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved productivity.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best way to evaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract.  However, the contracting officer shall consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on cost reduction.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  Consideration of the three basic components of profit—performance risk, contract type risk (including working capital), and facilities capital employed.  However, the contracting officer is not required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of the DD Form 1547.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Offset for facilities capital cost of money.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective by the amount of facilities capital cost of money under Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 414, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital (48 CFR 9904.414).  Cost of money under CAS 417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective.  The profit amount in the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  This adjustment is needed for the following reason:  The values of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from an element of profit to an element of contract cost (see FAR 31.205-10) and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance risk.  In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar adjustments shall be made to contracts that use alternate structured approaches.</p>
