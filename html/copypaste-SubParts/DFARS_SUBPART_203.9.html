Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this authority may not be brought more than 2 years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) An Inspector General determination and an agency head order denying relief under paragraph (2) of this section shall be admissible in evidence in any de novo action at law or equity brought pursuant to

            , the head of the agency or designee shall request the Department of Justice to file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the agency in accordance with 
               <a class="xref" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4701" target="_blank">10 U.S.C. 4701</a>
             may obtain judicial review of the order’s conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee. Review shall conform to Chapter 7 of Title 5, Unites States Code. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.</p>
